"1","David Johnson","ARI","RB1","8","When you see a 25-year-old running back getting 25.8 combined carries/targets, it's a given to put him as a clear-cut top player, especially when it's a player as talented as Johnson. His goal for this next season is set at 1,000 rushing and receiving yards, and it's well within the realm of possibilities."
"2","Le'Veon Bell","PIT","RB2","9","If Bell can stay on the field for all 16 games, it's quite possible that we see him break total yardage records. He's still yet to have a game in his NFL career with fewer than 7.8 PPR points. There's actually been just three of his 47 games with fewer than 10.9 PPR points."
"3","Antonio Brown","PIT","WR1","9","It's now four straight seasons where Brown has finished as a top-seven wide receiver, including two seasons as the No. 1 receiver. He's averaged 1,579 yards and 10.8 touchdowns in that span, and keep in mind that he posted his two best seasons while Martavis Bryant was on the field with him."
"4","Julio Jones","ATL","WR2","5","Julio is #1 in NFL history with 96.3 yards per game. With that being said, he is an increased injury risk over Brown and Beckham, plus he has been known to","dis"
"5","Odell Beckham Jr.","NYG","WR3","8","You're nit-picking when trying to decipher between Beckham, Jones, and Brown, but the area of concern for Beckham is his newfound competition for targets. Brandon Marshall and Evan Engram are going to see targets, potentially lowering Beckham's 169 target ceiling from last year. He's talented enough to make up for the decrease, but still a tick below Jones and Brown for me."
"6","LeSean McCoy","BUF","RB3","6","McCoy and the Bills running backs enjoyed a massive 2.56 yards before contact in 2016, which was 0.29 yards more than the next highest team. With Mike Gillislee now in New England, McCoy should keep his high workload, even with a new coaching staff in tow, as well as get a bit more goal-line work."
"7","A.J. Green","CIN","WR4","6","Green was dominating in 2016 before going down with a season-ending injury in Week 11. Throughout the first 10 weeks of the season, Green was the No. 4 fantasy receiver and on pace for over 1,700 yards and seven touchdowns. In the years he played all 16 games, his finishes are WR4, WR4, and WR7. Stay healthy, A.J."
"8","Mike Evans","TB","WR5","11","It's fair to say that Evans' sophomore season with just three touchdowns was an outlier, as he's scored 12 in each of his other two seasons. Had he scored his usual 12 touchdowns in 2015, he would have finished as the No. 7 wide receiver. Combine that with his No. 1 finish last year and No. 10 finish in 2014, and you have a safe first-round pick."
"9","Melvin Gordon","LAC","RB4","9","Despite averaging a mediocre 4.0 yards per carry heading into his Week 14 matchup where he hurt his knee, Gordon was sitting as the No. 3 fantasy running back. The Chargers have one of the most difficult passing schedules in the league, but also have receivers to pull defenders out of the box. Gordon should build on his 2016 season."
"10","Devonta Freeman","ATL","RB5","5","Freeman says he wanted to be the highest-paid running back in the NFL and the Falcons made that happen. Despite ranking 13th in carries last year, Freeman totaled the sixth-most fantasy points among running backs. After struggling a bit out of the gate, Freeman went on to score eight touchdowns in the final six regular season games. With Kyle Shanahan gone, it's possible the Falcons go back to more of a one-back system."
"11","Jordy Nelson","GB","WR6","8","It's coming to the point in his career where he'll take a turn in the wrong direction, but he didn't show any signs of that in 2016, finishing with 14 touchdowns. His yardage did slip to the lowest it's been since 2010 (sans injured 2012), and it'll likely continue to do so, but you can bank on double-digit touchdowns."
"12","DeMarco Murray","TEN","RB6","8","It was clear that Murray wore down as the season went on, averaging just 3.5 yards per carry over the final six weeks, after averaging 4.87 over the first 10 weeks. There was just one game all season in which he didn't touch the ball at least 16 times, so he should still be a low-end RB1 by default."
"13","Jay Ajayi","MIA","RB7","11","We mustn't forget that Ajayi wasn't even starting ahead of Arian Foster to start 2016 and was so mad about it that he didn't get to participate in Week 1. He played out of his mind for a few weeks, but against any defense that wasn't in the bottom-eight, he struggled. Some offensive line issues contributed to that, but expectations should be tempered, as there are also injury concerns."
"14","Michael Thomas","NO","WR7","5","It was quite the rookie campaign for Thomas, totaling 1,137 yards and nine touchdowns in 15 games, and that's despite not becoming a full-time player until Week 3. In his 13 games as a starter, Thomas went on a 16-game pace of 101/1,259/11. Brandin Cooks is gone and Ted Ginn is the only wide receiver they replaced him with. Thomas is going to be a WR1 as long as Brees is under center."
"15","Jordan Howard","CHI","RB8","9","There is concern over his lack of usage in the passing game, as the Bears signed free agent Benny Cunningham and drafted Tarik Cohen, who are both pass-game specialists. He finished second in the NFL in rushing yards, so you have to give him the benefit of the doubt, but there is some risk."
"16","Dez Bryant","DAL","WR8","6","The last time Dez was healthy, he finished as the WR4, but that was before Zeke came into town. Now that they have one of the best running games in football and go against the toughest SOS for WRs, Bryant should take a big step back even if he stays on the field."
"17","Doug Baldwin","SEA","WR9","6","He's now finished as a top-10 wide receiver in back-to-back seasons, and that was despite Russell Wilson taking a slight step back last year, though it was likely injury-related. His target numbers have gone up four straight seasons, as have the Seahawks pass attempts. They are attempting to get their run-game going again, but Baldwin is who moves the sticks."
"18","Amari Cooper","OAK","WR10","10","The fact that he finished as the No. 12 wide receiver despite catching just five touchdowns and seeing 13 redzone targets says something about his potential. His efficiency spiked in his second year with Derek Carr and Michael Crabtree will be on the wrong side of 30 when the season starts."
"19","T.Y. Hilton","IND","WR11","11","Did you know that Hilton led the league in receiving yards last year? He finished with 81 more yards than Odell Beckham Jr., though he scored just six touchdowns, which is the reason he's further down draft boards. It's now four straight 1,000-yard seasons for Hilton and Andrew Luck should finally be healthy this season."
"20","Todd Gurley","LAR","RB9","8","The Rams added Andrew Whitworth and Sammy Watkins which should help Gurley a ton, but there is still the fact that Jared Goff is his QB, so he may still see some stacked boxes. He still has the ceiling of a top 5 player and will get enough carries that he has a high floor too."
"21","Rob Gronkowski","NE","TE1","9","Gronk has made owners regret picking him several years because of injuries, but chances are that if you drafted him when he was healthy, you competed for a championship. He is finished #6, #11 and #6 in VBD during the years he has been healthy. Don't hesitate to take a gamble on that kind of upside deep into the second round of your drafts."
"22","Demaryius Thomas","DEN","WR12","5","Last season was the first one since 2011 where Thomas failed to record at least 1,300 yards, as he totaled just 1,083 with Trevor Siemian under center. The Broncos have added Carlos Henderson to the wide receiving corps, giving another playmaker who'll garner targets. Thomas is a solid third-round pick, though he lacks the upside I'm looking for."
"23","DeAndre Hopkins","HOU","WR13","7","Who would've thought that we'd love to have Brian Hoyer back in order to throw to Hopkins? A year after his breakout 1,500-yard season, Hopkins totaled just 954 yards on 151 targets. Those who have high hopes for him are likely depending on rookie quarterback Deshaun Watson taking over in fast order."
"24","Brandin Cooks","NE","WR14","9","Cooks was the #8 receiver in football last season with Drew Brees, and while the Patriots do have more weapons to spread the ball around to, they still have Tom Brady so Cooks should once again be a WR1."
"25","Isaiah Crowell","CLE","RB10","9","What do you get when you mix an average running back with a great offensive line? An RB2, that's Crowell in a nutshell. Most point to his yards per carry (4.8) being great last year, but he totaled 48 percent of his rushing yards on just 16 carries. Their offensive line may just be the best in the NFL at this point, making him an intriguing option."
"26","Keenan Allen","LAC","WR15","9","In 27 career games with 10 or less targets, Allen has averaged just 3.96 receptions and 49.2 yards per game, compared to the 11 games where he's seen 11 or more targets and averaged 10.36 receptions and 117.8 yards per game. With all the mouths to feed, it's hard to see him getting more than 10 in many games."
"27","Leonard Fournette","JAC","RB11","8","You don't draft a running back with the No. 4 overall pick and not play him. Fournette is a special player and even though he isn't a great receiver, the work will be there for him. I recently did a study on coaching changes and the effect they have on pass/run games. Everything is going in Fournette's favor."
"28","Ezekiel Elliott","DAL","RB12","6","Being suspended six games is a huge deal, especially when you consider the fact that the Cowboys have their bye in Week 7. This means you'll be without a top pick for seven weeks of the fantasy, which is over half the regular season. It's a risky proposition even taking him here, but we know that he has game winning upside when he takes the field."
"29","Lamar Miller","HOU","RB13","7","Despite getting all the work he possibly could last year, Miller disappointed finishing with the sixth-most carries, but just the 17th most fantasy points among running backs. He misses two games, but the workload was there. The Texans spent a third-round pick to acquire D'Onta Foreman, which adds concern to that workload hanging around."
"30","Travis Kelce","KC","TE2","10","It's possible that the Chiefs finally figured out how to use Kelce, as he totaled 8.2 targets per game over the final 10 games of the season, after averaging just 5.9 targets per game over the first 38 games of his career. He finished as the No. 1 tight end while scoring just four touchdowns. There's still room to grow."
"31","Terrelle Pryor","WAS","WR16","5","This athletic freak of nature joins a quarterback who will throw for at least 4,500 yards this season. With that being said, he is no longer the only weapon in his offense and Cousins likes to spread the ball around so temper your expecations."
"32","Alshon Jeffery","PHI","WR17","10","Battling injuries over the last two seasons where he's played just 22 games, Jeffery hasn't been the same without Marc Trestman. If he's going to live up to his mid-third-round ADP, he's going to have to score double-digit touchdowns."
"33","Golden Tate","DET","WR18","7","After starting the year as a droppable fantasy asset, Tate totaled 943 yards and four touchdowns over the final 11 games in 2016, which was good enough to be the No. 10 wide receiver in that span. The Lions lost Anquan Boldin and replaced him with a late third-round rookie."
"34","Allen Robinson","JAC","WR19","8","Betting on Robinson's talent to shine through, his targets are likely to decrease this year with the acquisition of Leonard Fournette, as well as a beefed-up defense. Despite having the exact same number of targets in each of the last two seasons, Robinson finished with a 517 yard and eight touchdown difference in 2016. There is built-in risk."
"35","Larry Fitzgerald","ARI","WR20","8","Entering what is likely his last NFL season, Fitzgerald has now put up back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons with Carson Palmer behind center. They added Chad Williams via the draft, but he needs time to develop. The only competition he has for targets over the middle of the field is David Johnson. Fitzgerald was also sixth in redzone targets last year with 23 of them."
"36","Christian McCaffrey","CAR","RB14","11","Jonathan Stewart is still looming, so don't look past it, but McCaffrey is the better talent and even if he doesn't get the lions share of the carries, he may be the best receiver in the draft class. There are so many ways for the rookie to pile up the points that it will happen one way or another."
"37","Michael Crabtree","OAK","WR21","10","There's a good possibility that Crabtree regresses this season, as he scored 55.7 of his 150 fantasy points on just 23 redzone targets in 2016. That was a far cry from his 13.8 points on 13 targets in 2015."
"38","Aaron Rodgers","GB","QB1","8","He's a machine, plain and simple. Year-over-year Rodgers builds his hall of fame resume, and it translates to fantasy, considering he's finished as the No. 1 or No. 2 quarterback in seven of nine seasons (was also No. 1 before getting hurt in 2013) since taking over for Brett Favre. There's so much uncertainty around this part of the rankings, he's simply a safer pick."
"39","Davante Adams","GB","WR22","8","From Week 4 on last season, the only wide receivers to outscore Adams were: Odell Beckham Jr., Jordy Nelson, Antonio Brown, and Mike Evans. That is it. Nelson will be playing at age-32 this season."
"40","Ty Montgomery","GB","RB15","8","Despite them drafting two running backs, Montgomery likely isn't going anywhere. He offers something in the passing game both Jamaal Williams and Aaron Jones don't, wide receiver skills. His 5.1 yards after contact was the best in the NFL last year, though the sample size was small. He is apparently dealing with a soft tissue injury, which is not ideal when you're fighting off three up-and-coming rookies who have been playing the position for a long time. Those types of injuries can also linger throughout the season, making Montgomery a risky pick at his current ADP."
"41","Dalvin Cook","MIN","RB16","9","When the Vikings signed Latavius Murray, most thought they were likely done addressing the position. But once they signed him, he had foot surgery, leading the Vikings to trade up and draft Cook. Playing behind one of the worst offensive lines in football will be tough for anyone, but look for them to give Cook every opportunity to win the starting job, and I suspect he will."
"42","Marshawn Lynch","OAK","RB17","10","I understand the want to love Lynch in Oakland, I really do. He was a great running back who'll be playing behind a great offensive line, and the plodding Latavius Murray scored 12 touchdowns last year, so why can't the bruising Lynch. He's been out of football for a year and a half, not rehabbing an injury, but building homes in Haiti. He's 31 years old, so keep expectations realistic."
"43","Tom Brady","NE","QB2","9","While everyone else tries to figure out who he'll will throw to and which running back will get the majority of the carries, just take Brady and enjoy your points."
"44","Carlos Hyde","SF","RB18","11","Don't buy the Joe Williams hype, even if he was hand-picked by the new regime. So was Tevin Coleman, but Devonta Freeman was the better player who got the bulk of the work. Hyde has broken 75 tackles over the last two years on just 370 touches and is one of the most elusive backs in the game. His 3.1 yards after contact last year ranked fifth among running backs with at least 100 carries."
"45","Jarvis Landry","MIA","WR23","11","Surely lower than most, I'm expecting Devante Parker to take a step forward in 2017. After averaging nine targets per game over the first 36 games of his career, Landry averaged just 7.1 targets over the final 12 games under Adam Gase. He's somewhat safe in PPR leagues, but there's not a whole lot of upside here."
"46","Greg Olsen","CAR","TE3","11","Call him boring, but he's been a top-four tight end for each of the last three years and hasn't finished outside of the top-eight since 2011. The concern is that he was just the No. 14 tight end from Week 8 through Week 17."
"47","Drew Brees","NO","QB3","5","Just a bit outside of the top-tier of quarterbacks, Brees is still a set-it-and-forget-it quarterback. Much have been made of his road splits, but he is simply â€˜less great' on the road. Over the last two years on the road he averages 297 passing yards, 1.73 touchdowns, and 0.93 interceptions, or 17.9 fantasy points per game. That average over 16 games would have been the No. 7 quarterback last year. Not so bad, eh?"
"48","Jordan Reed","WAS","TE4","5","The only remaining players Kirk Cousins will have in the offense from last year are Reed and Jamison Crowder. One of them is 6-2, 243 pounds, and a monster in the endzone. His health is always the concern, which is why he's a fifth/sixth-round pick instead of a third or fourth. He needs to fall considering all the risk you're taking on when you draft him."
"49","Joe Mixon","CIN","RB19","6","If we get clarity on Mixon being the starter and workhorse out of the gate, he's going to move up on this list. His talent wasn't ever the question, but rather the situation. Jeremy Hill apparently isn't going away and Gio Bernard is going to be healthy enough to start the season. This is going to be a messy timeshare, and although Mixon is the most talented, it may take some time for him to be a consistent fantasy option."
"50","Mark Ingram","NO","RB20","5","Despite playing in a clear timeshare last year where he failed to see more than 18 carries in all but one game, Ingram finished as the No. 10 running back. Sure, Peterson is going to steal some work, probably slightly more than Tim Hightower did. But getting him as the 20th running back off the board is a steal."
"51","Danny Woodhead","BAL","RB21","10","It's tough to figure out where Woodhead fits in at this point of his career, but he's going to be fantasy-relevant out of necessity. The Ravens threw the ball more than any other team in the NFL last year, with the running backs seeing 142 of them, which was tied for the second-most in the league. He's an excellent pick in PPR leagues."
"52","Sammy Watkins","LAR","WR24","8","If you extend Watkins' 8 games out to a full season, he would have just had 860 yards and 4 touchdowns, which is worse than Adam Thielen, but consider that over the previous 14 healthy games he has outperformed Antonio Brown. Granted, he is playing with perhaps the worst QB in football now, but there is still a considerable ceiling."
"53","Bilal Powell","NYJ","RB22","11","We really want to get confirmation that he's going to be the starter, but all signs point to that being the case. He totaled 411 yards on 82 carries (5.01 YPC) over the last four games of 2016 and was the No. 2 running back over that time, behind only Le'Veon Bell."
"54","Tyreek Hill","KC","WR25","10","I can understand moving Hill up your list if you draft on upside alone, though I'm expecting massive regression with Hill. Not only did he score three special teams touchdowns, but he also scored nine rushing/receiving touchdowns on just 85 offensive touches (one every 9.4 touches). No receiver with more than 45 receptions scored a touchdown more than one every 10.1 targets in 2016, and that was Davante Adams who catches passes from Aaron Rodgers. Outside of Packers receivers, the next highest was Anquan Boldin at one every 11.9 targets. Hill is still catching passes from Alex Smith the last I checked, so I'm not betting on his crazy touchdown per touch ratio happening again."
"55","Stefon Diggs","MIN","WR26","9","Diggs clearly has a ton of talent at the potential to break out as a WR2, but lets not forget that Diggs finished behind Adam Thielen in receiving yards last season. Diggs was only startable in four games all of last season so just know that you are drafting a risky play."
"56","Emmanuel Sanders","DEN","WR27","5","Did you know he's now 30-years-old? He's also the No. 2 receiver on a team that wants to run the ball more in 2017. His year was very up-and-down in 2016 and you should expect more of the same in 2017."
"57","Jamison Crowder","WAS","WR28","5","I wanted to put Crowder higher in my rankings, but without knocking Terrelle Pryor into low-end WR3 territory, it wasn't happening. Crowder scored as many touchdowns as DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon combined last year (7), but still saw fewer targets than the both of them. Love the player, not necessarily the situation."
"58","C.J. Anderson","DEN","RB23","5","Anderson has averaged a massive 4.56 yards per carry in his career, while those around him over the last couple of years have totaled a measly 3.90 yards per carry with the team. The Broncos beefed up their offensive line this off-season via free agency (Former Cowboys guard Ron Leary) as well as using their first-round pick on tackle Garrett Bolles. The Broncos paid a lot of money to keep Anderson around last off-season."
"59","Jimmy Graham","SEA","TE5","6","I'm likely lower than most, but Graham really struggled down the stretch, even with Russell Wilson coming on. After totaling 89 or more yards in four of the first eight games, Graham failed to top 67 yards the remainder of the season. He's still a solid pick, just not the top-three pick that he always was."
"60","Martavis Bryant","PIT","WR29","9","Don't sleep on how good Bryant was when on the field, as eight of his 21 career games have netted 14 or more standard fantasy points, including four of them with 20 or more. The Steelers just cut Ladarius Green, freeing up even more targets than initially thought."
"61","Russell Wilson","SEA","QB4","6","Despite playing on one leg for a majority of the season, Wilson still managed to finish as a QB1 in 2016. If you were to get into his game log, you'd see that he was a different quarterback over the second-half of the season, finishing as the No. 4 quarterback from Week 9 through Week 17."
"62","Ameer Abdullah","DET","RB24","7","It's been a disappointing career thus far, but the Lions didn't add a goal-line back via free agency or the draft, which tells me that Abdullah will get the first crack at the starting job. Theo Riddick also had surgery on both of his wrists, which could potentially lead to more work in the passing game."
"63","Spencer Ware","KC","RB25","10","Ware ended the season looking like a running back who just might lose his job to a hot young rookie like Kareem Hunt, but try to remember just how impressive he was before the concussion. If we see that Ware again in Andy Reid's offense, there is no reason he can't be a top-eight RB. With that being said, there are significant question marks lingering."
"64","Willie Snead","NO","WR30","5","He's been under-the-radar this off-season, despite the trade that sent Brandin Cooks away. While they play different roles, the absence of Cooks clears up 120-plus targets. He may have had the quietest top-35 season ever in 2016. Did you know he finished with more fantasy points than DeAndre Hopkins?"
"65","Matt Ryan","ATL","QB5","5","Some may say this is too low, but Ryan isn't going to repeat his 7.1 percent touchdown rate, as his previous career-high was 5.2 percent. His yards per attempt was also 1.8 yards more than his previous career-high. Regression is coming for Matty Ice."
"66","Kelvin Benjamin","CAR","WR31","11","He's finished inside the top-20 wide receivers in both seasons he's played, but it's hard to feel confident in him, knowing that he's had weight issues for the second-straight off-season. The additions of Christian McCaffrey and Curtis Samuel will likely eat up some of the shorter targets that used to go to him."
"67","Tevin Coleman","ATL","RB26","5","Still feels too high for a backup running back who just lost one of the best offensive coordinators in football, but he does offer splash potential. Had just two games with more than 58 rushing yards in 2016, and touchdowns regression is all but certain."
"68","Pierre Garcon","SF","WR32","11","One of my favorite targets in season-long leagues, Garcon is going to give you what you pay for. The last season he played under Kyle Shanahan was 2013 when he led the NFL in targets with 182 of them. The 49ers paid him a lot of money to come there, and he's legitimately their only starting-caliber receiver."
"69","Kyle Rudolph","MIN","TE6","9","People left the bandwagon too early on him, myself included. But when you see the chemistry between him and Sam Bradford, you should be buying in. He saw a position-high 132 targets last year, including 8.7 per game once offensive coordinator Pat Shurmer took over. Keep in mind that he finished as the No. 3 tight end, while both Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs got theirs."
"70","Brandon Marshall","NYG","WR33","8","If you want to take away targets from Odell Beckham Jr. in order to get Marshall into WR2 territory, you can take that venture, but I won't be on it. He's entering his age-34 season and he just came off a season where he saw 128 targets, yet finished as the No. 52 receiver. The last time someone saw more than 120 targets and finished outside the top 36 was 2014, where both Vincent Jackson and Andre Johnson accomplished that feat. They are both out of football at this point."
"71","Frank Gore","IND","RB27","11","We don't know how long he'll hold onto the job, seeing as he has averaged just 3.8 yards per carry since coming to the Colts. He's also scored just 10 touchdowns on the ground, leading them to use Robert Turbin in goal-line situations last year. They also drafted Marlon Mack, who could supplant Gore at any time."
"72","Tyler Eifert","CIN","TE7","6","Now has 18 touchdowns over the last two seasons despite playing in just 21 games and being targeted 121 times. No player has a higher touchdown rate over the last two seasons, including Rob Gronkowski. If it appears he'll start the season healthy, he'll move up this list."
"73","Theo Riddick","DET","RB28","7","With Ameer Abdullah coming back, look for Riddick to go back to his change-of-pace role that he had in 2015, where he totaled over 600 yards receiving, but failed to top seven carries in any game. He's essentially the Darren Sproles of the Lions offense, but younger."
"74","Kirk Cousins","WAS","QB6","5","Since 2014, here is the list of quarterbacks who've thrown for more yards per attempt than Kirk Cousins (min. 600 attempts): Ben Roethlisberger and Matt Ryan. That's it. While he did lose Desean Jackson and Pierre Garcon, they attempted to right that by acquiring Terrelle Pryor. He'll also get last year's first-round pick Josh Doctson on the field, attempting to take over Garcon's role in the offense. It may take time to get acclimated, but Cousins is a back-end QB1."
"75","Andrew Luck","IND","QB7","11","The last of the quarterbacks you should consider in the top-40 players, Luck is a player who can throw for 5,000 yards and 40 touchdowns. Prior to hurting his shoulder, Luck threw for 4,761 yards and 40 touchdowns, so we weren't far off. His weapons are arguably as good as they've ever been."
"76","Jeremy Maclin","BAL","WR34","10","In what was probably the best move for his fantasy value, Maclin was released by the Chiefs only to be picked up by the Ravens just a few days later. It's rare for the Chiefs to total more than 500 pass attempts, while the Ravens led the NFL with 678 pass attempts last year. They also lost Steve Smith, whose role now belongs to Maclin. Over his time with the Ravens, Smith totaled 8.32 targets per game. If Maclin takes over that role and sees 130 targets, he's a steal at his current ADP."
"77","Mike Gillislee","NE","RB29","9","The Patriots ran the ball more often inside the 5-yard line than any other team in the NFL and it wasn't even close. Blount was among the worst RBs in terms of yards per carry, Gillislee was the single best. Gillislee has also been the best at converting goal line carries over the past two seasons. He could be in for a huge season if Belichek puts the ball in his hands enough."
"78","Donte Moncrief","IND","WR35","11","Over the last two seasons, there have been just four games in which both Andrew Luck and Moncrief played in where they didn't connect for a touchdown. Luck is finally healthy and Moncrief is entering a contract-year."
"79","Zach Ertz","PHI","TE8","10","Every year Zach Ertz ends the season on fire and every year he gets overdrafted as a result. The opposite may happen this season, however, as everyone is tired of getting burned by the hype. The matter of the fact is that he saw 112 targets lst season for 853 yards. At 58.3 yards per game, he was only behind Kelce, Gronk and Olsen among tight ends so make of that what you will."
"80","Delanie Walker","TEN","TE9","8","Going from seeing 133 targets in 2015, to just 102 last season is quite the difference for a tight end. The additions of Rishard Matthews and Tajae Sharpe proved to be enough to decrease his workload, but now they've added two even better players in Corey Davis and Taywan Taylor. He'll also be 33-years-old before the season starts."
"81","Devante Parker","MIA","WR36","11","Here, we have the most highly hyped wideout of the preseason. He is receiving glowing praises for his off-season improvements, and now that he is with Jay Cutler, he may just live up to that potential for Miami this season."
"82","Marcus Mariota","TEN","QB8","8","It's hard not to take notice as to what the Titans have done this off-season, precisely in their attempts to get Mariota more weapons. Not only did they draft Corey Davis and Taywan Taylor, they also went out and signed Eric Decker to a one-year contract. If Mariota disappoints, it won't be because of the talent around him."
"83","Cameron Meredith","CHI","WR37","9","Despite catching passes from the same quarterbacks and seeing essentially the same number of targets, Meredith finished with 67 more yards and two more touchdowns than Alshon Jeffery last year. He suffered a broken thumb during OTA's which could derail his ascension up the depth chart, as he's out until training camp. There is plenty of risk considering the Bears signing Victor Cruz, Kendall Wright, and Marcus Wheaton, but we also know that there's plenty of upside."
"84","DeSean Jackson","TB","WR38","11","He'll be drafted much higher than this, but Jackson is going to find it tough to crack the top-30 with Mike Evans on the other side of the field. This was a better real-life football signing than it was for fantasy purposes. He'll turn 31-years-old at the end of the season."
"85","Jameis Winston","TB","QB9","11","Everything that has happened this off-season for the Bucs, has happened because they want Winston to have all the tools to succeed. It would have been nice to see them build up the offensive line a bit, but really good wide receivers can help make up for that. He's finished inside the top 16 quarterbacks each of his first two seasons, and this is the season he takes the leap into the top 12."
"86","Adrian Peterson","NO","RB30","5","Most have dubbed him as dead at this point in his career, though I'm not sure that's the case. The problem, however, is that Mark Ingram is likely better than him at this moment. He should see something similar to the role Tim Hightower had the last few years, making him a touchdown-dependent flex play."
"87","Paul Perkins","NYG","RB31","8","After the Giants passed on all free agent running backs, it appears to be the Perkins show in New York. He was better than perceived at the end of 2016, and will now be on the field with Odell Beckham Jr., Brandon Marshall, Sterling Shepard, and Evan Engram. He's going to see some light defensive fronts in a high-scoring offense."
"88","Doug Martin","TB","RB32","11","Coming back to a team with Mike Evans, DeSean Jackson, O.J. Howard, and Chris Godwin will be a welcoming sight for Martin, who only has three games left on his suspension. We've seen a hit-or-miss Martin over his career, but he has finished as a top-three running back twice. He could be a steal at this point."
"89","Duke Johnson","CLE","RB33","9","You don't have to draft Johnson in this spot to get him, as his ADP is currently 13.11 as the 174th player off the board. Not only will Johnson have borderline flex-value while playing second-fiddle to Isaiah Crowell, but he'd be an RB1 if Crowell were to miss time. Johnson's talent is the reason he was drafted in the seventh-round last year, not because of his situation."
"90","Cam Newton","CAR","QB10","11","He's now finished as the QB17 in two of his last three seasons, and the Panthers want to take away the thing that creates his fantasy points, running the ball. Not only did they extend Jonathan Stewart, but they drafted Christian McCaffrey with a top-eight pick, and took hybrid running back/wide receiver Curtis Samuel in the second-round. In the 11 games after his concussion last year, Newton ran the ball just 61 times for 212 yards and three touchdowns, a far cry from his 100-plus carry, 600-yard rushing seasons in the past."
"91","Eric Decker","TEN","WR39","8","It's unclear as to what is going on with Decker right now, but as of now, we have to assume he's on the team. He's played with some horrid quarterbacks during his career, yet he's totaled at least 962 yards or eight touchdowns in every season he's been a starter, as well as finishing as a top-36 receiver."
"92","Terrance West","BAL","RB34","10","Fresh to start last season, West averaged 4.70 yards per carry with three touchdowns in the first six games, but struggled down the stretch, averaging just 3.43 yards per carry once Dixon joined the backfield. He also scored just two rushing touchdowns over the final 10 games with Dixon, making him unplayable. As of right now, there is no competition for the early-down work with Dixon out for the year. Despite the fact that the Ravens have ranked in the bottom-five for running back rush attempts the last two years, West presents solid flex value, just limit your expectations for his upside."
"93","Tyrell Williams","LAC","WR40","9","Just one year after finishing as the No. 13 wide receiver, there are plenty of question marks surrounding Williams. Not only is Keenan Allen returning from injury, but the Chargers surprised everyone by drafting Mike Williams with the No. 7 pick in the draft. Competition for targets is the key here, and by the Chargers actions, they'll be hard to come by for last year's breakout receiver. He still offers plenty of upside later in drafts."
"94","Martellus Bennett","GB","TE10","8","While the Packers offense doesn't necessarily target the tight end position that much, Bennett was someone who they went out and paid good money to acquire. The Packers simply don't spend money if free agency, making him that much more intriguing. The projections aren't this high on him, but there's massive upside if they do change things up a bit."
"95","Randall Cobb","GB","WR41","8","If you're going to bet on any player to bounce back from a bad season, bet on a player who has Aaron Rodgers throwing him the football. Cobb has finished as a top-12 wide receiver (points per game) twice in his career, and still showed flashes despite struggling to play through injuries for much of the year.  Jordy Nelson is 32-years-old and Davante Adams still has a lot to prove."
"96","Kenny Britt","CLE","WR42","9","Some are calling Britt a steal where he's being drafted, but I'd say that he's right where he should be. Did you know that he had never totaled more than 775 yards in any one season before 2016? Or how about the fact that he has recorded more than five touchdowns just once in his career? Now he's going to a team that's got Corey Coleman, an up-and-coming phenom, and David Njoku, the top tight end prospect on some analysts boards. But the real story is that he's going to be catching passes from either Cody Kessler, a quarterback who threw just six touchdowns on 195 attempts last year, or DeShone Kizer, a rookie whose college coach said that he should still be in college."
"97","Kareem Hunt","KC","RB35","10","Andy Reid always puts out a quality running game, and while Spencer Ware is the current favorite to see the majority of the carries, it is worth noting that he was less than mediocre after his concussions last season and could be on a short leash. Should he continue to perform under expecatations, Hunt would step into a terrific scheme that would make him startable every single week."
"98","Derek Carr","OAK","QB11","10","As good as Carr looks at times, he's been very volatile as a fantasy option. Carr turned heads with his 35.8 point performance against the Buccaneers last year, but in his other 14 games, Carr was very mediocre. He totaled just 16.6 points per game in all other games, which would have ranked 17th among quarterbacks last year. His schedule is among the worst in football and they just brought in Marshawn Lynch to steal some touchdowns."
"99","Jordan Matthews","BUF","WR43","6","With Sammy Watkins out of Buffalo and Matthews in as presumably the team's #1 receiver, Matthews ceiling bumps to a low-end WR2. The Bills will be bad enough this season that they should have plenty of positive game scripts for the passing game."
"100","Ben Roethlisberger","PIT","QB12","9","When I initially did my rankings, Roethlisberger was ranked as my No. 12 quarterback, but something big has happened since that time. Martavis Bryant was reinstated. He's played 19 career games with Bryant, averaging 337 yards and 2.11 touchdowns in those games. You have to deal with his road struggles, but his home games will win you weeks."
"101","Eric Ebron","DET","TE11","7","Despite missing three games last year, Ebron finished with the eighth-most yards among tight ends. Had he continued on the same pace for all 16 games, he would have only trailed Travis Kelce, Greg Olsen, and Jimmy Graham. With Anquan Boldin gone, it frees up plenty of targets for both him and Marvin Jones in the red-zone. He could be the tight end drafted outside the top-15 who finishes top-five."
"102","Adam Thielen","MIN","WR44","9","Despite the fact that I'm a huge Stefon Diggs fan, one cannot escape the fact that Thielen saw 20 fewer targets, yet finished with 64 more yards and two more touchdowns. Once Diggs moved into the slot, Thielen started to do most of his damage, including his 202-yard, two touchdown performance in Week 16 against the Packers. He's still got a lot to prove, but 2016 was incredibly promising for the former undrafted free agent."
"103","Mike Wallace","BAL","WR45","10","The Ravens likely held onto his contract because they didn't have another receiver to step up and command 100-plus targets this season, and they didn't draft one either. Wallace has finished as a top-28 wide receiver in seven of his eight seasons and is in a good position to do the same in 2017."
"104","Dak Prescott","DAL","QB13","6","Was the No. 6 quarterback last year on a points per game basis if you were to remove Week 17 when he was pulled after one series. There were only four quarterbacks who were QB1's in 68.8 percent of their games last year: Tom Brady, Matt Ryan, Aaron Rodgers, and Prescott (that includes his Week 17 game). My biggest concern is his schedule."
"105","James White","NE","RB36","9","The ""should have been"" Super Bowl MVP has been underrated this off-season, but not by the people that matter most. The Patriots extended him this off-season and paid him more than any other running back on the roster. He was the only player who finished in the top-36 last year without seeing at least 110 touches. If his role grows, as we expect it to, White should be in the running to finish as an RB2 in PPR leagues and a solid RB3 in standard leagues."
"106","Robert Kelley","WAS","RB37","5","Most remember Kelley for his Monday night performance against the Packers in Week 11 where he finished with 137 yards and three touchdowns, but they must've missed what ensued after that game. In the final six games of the season, Kelley averaged just 3.33 yards per carry on 84 carries with two touchdowns. He averaged just 8.05 fantasy points per game in that stretch, leading the Redskins to go out and snag Samaje Perine in the NFL Draft. You shouldn't bet on him to retain the starting job for very long, as he can only contribute on first and second down, making the offense predictable."
"107","Philip Rivers","LAC","QB14","9","A brutal start to his schedule will likely prevent Rivers from reaching the heights that most have set for him. He'll have to play the Broncos twice, Chiefs, Giants, Raiders, Patriots, and Jaguars in the first nine games. His numbers have fallen off after Week 8 in the three past seasons, so keep your expectations for him realistic."
"108","Eddie Lacy","SEA","RB38","6","All weight jokes aside, Lacy has always been a bigger guy, but that didn't stop him from finishing as the No. 6 running back in back-to-back seasons to start his career. The offensive line is a problem, but it was also a problem in Green Bay, as the Packers running backs averaged a league-low 1.0 yards before contact in 2016. We're just looking for 15 touches per game from him at this point, but his stock is falling as Thomas Rawls has reportedly outplayed him in training camp."
"109","C.J. Prosise","SEA","RB39","6","We were only able to see 47 touches for the rookie in 2016, but they were extremely impressive, netting 380 total yards and a touchdown. The concern is that the Seahawks brought in Eddie Lacy, as they were clearly unhappy with the health of their running backs last year. With the versatility that Prosise offers, it shouldn't shock anyone if he gets 10-12 touches out of the gate. If he can stay healthy, Pete Carroll will find ways to utilize him in the passing game."
"110","Matthew Stafford","DET","QB15","7","Stafford finished as the No. 7 quarterback in 2016, but his totals were nothing to write home about, especially over the final 10 games. After throwing three or more touchdowns in four of their first six games, Stafford didn't have a single game with more than two touchdowns the rest of the season. He turned into somewhat of a game manager, which is good for their team, but not so much for your fantasy team. He scored more than 17 fantasy points just twice after Week 6."
"111","Jack Doyle","IND","TE12","11","Despite playing alongside Dwayne Allen and with a less-than-100-percent Andrew Luck, Doyle was able to finish as the No. 13 tight end last year, yet his ADP is currently in the 13th round as the 16th tight end off the board. If Doyle isn't in your top-12 tight ends, you should be expecting big things from Erik Swoope."
"112","LeGarrette Blount","PHI","RB40","10","I'm not buying another double-digit touchdown season from Blount, as he's almost 31-years-old and was very mediocre outside of his time in New England. You thought Ryan Mathews was frustrating under Doug Pederson? Good luck with Blount."
"113","Corey Coleman","CLE","WR46","9","Drafted to be a game-changer, Coleman will look to get back on track after an injury-filled rookie season where we saw glimpses of the player he could be. Kenny Britt will command targets, sure, but nowhere close to the 140 that Terrelle Pryor saw last year. It shouldn't shock you if Coleman finishes as a top-24 wide receiver in 2017."
"114","Derrick Henry","TEN","RB41","8","It shouldn't shock you if Henry takes over as the lead-dog in the Titans backfield, as he's in his prime, while Murray is on the wrong side of 29. Henry averaged 4.96 yards per carry with four touchdowns over the final five weeks, while Murray averaged just 3.5 yards per carry and scored one touchdown over his final six games."
"115","Hunter Henry","LAC","TE13","9","I get it, he finished as the No. 11 tight end in his rookie season. He also saw just 53 targets despite Keenan Allen, Travis Benjamin, Antonio Gates, and Melvin Gordon being hurt at times during the year. That was also before Mike Williams was drafted at No. 7 overall. Unless Henry scores a touchdown every 6.6 targets like he did last year, it's unlikely he comes close to his current TE8 ADP."
"116","Matt Forte","NYJ","RB42","11","It was one of those situations, where Forte lost his job while trying to deal with an injury last year. Some have said that Powell was playing because Forte was hurt, but that wasn't the case over the final two weeks. Considering what the Jets are paying Forte, he's going to have a role, but you can't expect too much out of a soon-to-be 32-year-old running back."
"117","Darren Sproles","PHI","RB43","10","Over the last three seasons while in Philadelphia, Sproles has finished with 716, 705, and 865 total yards. Pretty consistent, right? I'd say the first two are the likeliest of scenarios, because the increase last year was out of necessity with Ryan Mathews shelved. The addition of LeGarrette Blount will also take away a few scoring opportunities, but Sproles also produces for those looking for a low-upside flex option."
"118","Rishard Matthews","TEN","WR47","8","He's not going to just disappear now that Corey Davis is in town, but he was due for touchdown regression regardless. There were just two wide receivers with more than 100 targets who caught more touchdowns on a per target basis, Jordy Nelson and Davante Adams. They both have Aaron Rodgers throwing to them."
"119","John Brown","ARI","WR48","8","Brown is Mike Tagliere's dude this season, but every other accurate expert we've heard from this season loves Brown as an underdrafted breakout candidate this season now that he is healthy again."
"120","Andy Dalton","CIN","QB16","6","Most don't know that Dalton has finished as a top-12 fantasy quarterback in three of the last five years, including a No. 4 finish in 2013. He's got some issues on the offensive line, but he also has the best receiving options he's ever had, and it's really not all that close."
"121","Jonathan Stewart","CAR","RB44","11","It's been a roller coaster of an off-season for Stewart, as he had his contract extended, but then witnessed his team select two running backs with their first two picks. While Curtis Samuel isn't a traditional running back, he will get carries. And to spend a top-eight pick on a running back says a lot how they feel about their current situation. It's hard to see Stewart finish with more than 120 carries this season and he doesn't catch passes, so we're left with non-starter type numbers."
"122","Corey Davis","TEN","WR49","8","He's an amazing talent and one that should be a force in the league for years to come, but it's a rare scenario in which a rookie comes in at wide receiver to dominate right away. Settling him in the WR3 range is the most likely of scenarios."
"123","Marvin Jones","DET","WR50","7","Just how good was Marvin Jones' start to 2016? Good enough that despite totaling just 448 yards and two touchdowns over the final 12 weeks, that he still finished as a top-40 wide receiver. His 482 yards and two touchdowns over the first four games were good enough to be the No. 3 receiver, behind only Julio Jones and Antonio Brown. With Anquan Boldin gone, we should see Jones' touchdown total shoot up. There's room for WR2 numbers in this offense."
"124","Darren McFadden","DAL","RB45","6","If you're looking for a guy who'll start for six weeks and give you top-12 performances most of the time, here's your guy. Even if you don't draft Ezekiel Elliott, you can snag McFadden and trade him to the Elliott owner after they start their season 0-2 or something like that. In all reality, McFadden makes a solid pick in the 8th round."
"125","Jason Witten","DAL","TE14","6","Boring, sure, but Witten hasn't finished outside the top-14 at his position since 2003, his rookie year. Looking at the Cowboys schedule, it looks better for him than it does for Dez Bryant, who will see a lot of the league's top-tier cornerbacks. If you're looking for a low-upside, though safe option at an extremely volatile position, Witten is the guy for you."
"126","Eli Manning","NYG","QB17","8","The last time Manning had a season like the one he did in 2016, was 2013 when he threw for just 3,818 yards, 18 touchdowns, and 27 interceptions. What he did the following two seasons was near pro-bowl caliber, averaging just over 4,400 yards and 33 touchdowns. The additions of Brandon Marshall and Evan Engram should only help him get back to that area. If not, this may be the end for the two-time Super Bowl champion."
"127","Tyrod Taylor","BUF","QB18","6","Finished as the QB7 on a point per game basis in 2016, and was after finishing as the QB8 in 2015. He continues to be one of the most under-appreciated players in all of fantasy. The Bills went out and spent a high-2nd-round pick in order to snag wide receiver Zay Jones, signed free agent Anquan Boldin, and traded for Jordan Matthews. This is all negated, of course, by the fact that they traded away his true No. 1 wide receiver in Sammy Watkins. Taylor has only averaged one fewer fantasy point per game without Watkins playing, though it's not the largest of sample sizes. Losing Watkins really hurts."
"128","Thomas Rawls","SEA","RB46","6","After averaging 5.6 yards per carry in his rookie season, Rawls just didn't look the same returning from his ankle surgery, averaging just 3.2 yards per carry. He's someone who continually works his way up my draft board, as he is reportedly looking more and more like his 2015-self. If that's the case, he could be one of the steals at the end of drafts."
"129","Coby Fleener","NO","TE15","5","Most don't realize that Fleener finished as the No. 12 fantasy tight end last year, despite playing what seemed to be his worst year as a professional. While it was a down year for the tight end position as a whole, it just goes to show how unpredictable the position is. When you have Drew Brees throwing to you, it's hard to say that many other tight ends have the weekly ceiling that Fleener does. With Brandin Cooks off to New England, someone needs to step up in the passing game, especially over the middle of the field."
"130","Giovani Bernard","CIN","RB47","6","It's getting more and more likely that Bernard isn't ready for the start of the 2017 season, which would give rookie Joe Mixon a clear leg-up on the receiving duties for the Bengals. He's also coming back from a torn ACL, which could take some time for him to regain his form. A player who's offered little upside since coming into the league, he's not someone who'll help you win fantasy titles."
"131","Zay Jones","BUF","WR51","6","With the recent signing of Anquan Boldin and the acquisition of Sammy Watkins, the Bills are telling us Zay might not quite be ready. He was tremendous in college as a possession receiver, and if given snaps, could be an impact rookie. He is a lottery ticket at this point."
"132","Ted Ginn","NO","WR52","5","It's quite possible that Ginn moves up the rankings if we see him in two wide receiver sets for the Saints. While Cam Newton's arm fit his skill-set, he's now got one of the best deep ball quarterbacks in the league throwing to him. Ginn is a fantastic bench player to draft, and once he has a big week, sell high, as he won't carry much week-to-week consistency."
"133","Sterling Shepard","NYG","WR53","8","There were 41 players who saw at least 100 targets in 2016, and just four scored more touchdowns on a per-target basis: Davante Adams, Jordy Nelson, Rishard Matthews, and Antonio Brown. Not too bad for a rookie, right? The additions of Brandon Marshall and Evan Engram cloud his outlook, but he just might surprise people who take a chance on him later in drafts."
"134","Jacquizz Rodgers","TB","RB48","11","Rodgers saw a huge load of carries when Martin was down last year and the same thing could happen in the first three weeks of the season, but Charles Sims will be battling him for carries now too so try to keep the expectations more realistic. There is, however, a chance that Martin slips up and then you have a full-time starter on your hands here."
"135","Denver Broncos","","DST1","5","They have two tremendous cornerbacks who can make plays and a number of useful pass rushers. The Broncos should again be regarded as a top 2 fantasy defense."
"136","Samaje Perine","WAS","RB49","5","This is based on pure assumption that Perine gets the starting job by Week 4. If he gets named the starter in the preseason, Perine would be moved into the 50-60 overall pick range. Perine can do everything Rob Kelley can do on first and second-down even better, and he can actually catch the ball. Stay tuned."
"137","Carson Palmer","ARI","QB19","8","It's pretty obvious that Palmer's 2015 season was an outlier in what's been a mediocre career. Despite throwing 60 more passes in 2016, he finished with 438 fewer yards and nine fewer touchdowns. It didn't help that John Brown was injured for a majority of the season and that Michael Floyd turned bad. They added Chad Williams in the NFL Draft, but he's an extremely raw receiver. You should expect a slight increase on his 2016 totals, but don't expect him to return to 2015 form."
"138","C.J. Fiedorowicz","HOU","TE16","7","Most are convinced that it was the player who became a solid possession style tight end last year, but what I saw was a safety valve for Brock Osweiler. I don't think Fiedorowicz is a phenomenal talent or anything, but rather someone who benefited from his quarterback's style of play. We'll see if Tom Savage and Deshaun Watson target him as much, but my guess would be ""no."""
"139","Austin Hooper","ATL","TE17","5","Expecting him to get more snaps/targets, Hooper was extremely efficient with his looks last year. Despite seeing more than three targets just three times, he rattled off six games with at least 41 yards and/or a touchdown. The Falcons didn't re-sign Jacob Tamme, showing confidence in the rookie going forward."
"140","Carson Wentz","PHI","QB20","10","Wentz is a popular breakout candidate among the fantasy community, but nothing about his 2016 season suggests that, as he got worse as the season went on. After competing 67.4 percent of his passes for 7.5 yards per attempt with seven touchdowns and one interception in his first four NFL starts, Wentz trended downward. Over the next 12 games, he completed just 61 percent of his throws for 5.9 yards per attempt with nine touchdowns and 13 interceptions. The additions of Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith should help, but he needs to show us that he's capable before investing more."
"141","Seattle Seahawks","","DST2","6","Seattle has been losing pieces in order to stay under the cap, but they are still loaded with talent and some of the best playmakers on the defensive side of the ball in all of football. Consider them a top 3 defense once again."
"142","Houston Texans","","DST3","7","The Texans were a top defense last season even without JJ Watt, just think about that for a second. Watt moving to virtually any team would make them a top 5 fantasy defense overnight."
"143","Cole Beasley","DAL","WR54","6","A solid bye week filler in PPR leagues, Beasley finished as a WR3 in 7 of 16 games last year, but he lacks any ceiling. He now also has competition on the roster with rookie Ryan Switzer, who is nearly a clone of Beasley."
"144","Josh Doctson","WAS","WR55","5","Don't forget that Doctson was the No. 1 pick for the Redskins last year and that head coach Jay Gruden compared him to A.J. Green. All reports coming back from OTA's were positive and beat reporters are saying that he'll attempt to take over the Pierre Garcon role. This would be great news, as Garcon has seen 111 and 114 targets over the last two years."
"145","Cameron Brate","TB","TE18","11","Don't be scared off by the fact that the Bucs drafted O.J. Howard and to a lesser extent, Chris Godwin. Sure, Howard is a great tight end prospect, but rookie tight ends rarely perform, and the fact is, Brate was #1 in the NFL in yards per route run so there is reason to believe he will again be an large part of the Bucs' offense."
"146","Kevin White","CHI","WR56","9","It's been an incredibly disappointing start to White's career, but the Bears are going to give him every opportunity to live up to his draft spot in 2017. They're concerned about his health and whether or not it has affected his speed in and out of his breaks, but as long as he's on the field, he'll be targeted by Mike Glennon. If he plays all 16 games, it's hard to see any scenario where he doesn't see at least 110 targets. If that's the case, he should finish in the WR3/4 range."
"147","Robby Anderson","NYJ","WR57","11","With Enunwa now out for the season, Anderson is expected to step up as the top receiving option for the Jets. While they will be playing most games from behind, the QB situation is not ideal so his upside is limited to a WR3."
"148","Chris Thompson","WAS","RB50","5","While some argue about Robert Kelley and Samaje Perine until they're blue in the face, Thompson continues to be looked over. Most don't realize that Thompson finished as the No. 28 running back in PPR leagues last year, and that was with Pierre Garcon and DeSean Jackson on the roster. His role can actually grow despite the addition of Perine."
"149","Julius Thomas","MIA","TE19","11","Going back to play with Adam Gase has a lot of fantasy owners expecting big things, but Thomas needs to stay on the field before anything. There are plenty of other targets in the offense that it's hard to see him seeing more than 4-5 targets per week. Did you know that there were just six games he finished with more than 28 yards while playing with the Jaguars (span of 21 games)?"
"150","Kansas City Chiefs","","DST4","10","The Chiefs continue to beat regression and force an unebelieveable amount of turnovers. Even without the most talented players, it is time to recognize that they defy normal standards."
"151","Tyler Lockett","SEA","WR58","6","I'm still extremely worried about him. For as gruesome as his injury was, it's good to see him close to returning, but you have to wonder what an injury like that does to someone who relied on speed and agility as much as Lockett does. If he truly is back to 100 percent, he's one of the steals in fantasy drafts."
"152","Jeremy Hill","CIN","RB51","6","After averaging 5.1 yards per carry in an impressive rookie campaign, Hill never regained that form, averaging just 3.67 yards per carry over the last two seasons. When looking at small sample sizes, things get dicey, but Hill has had plenty of time to showcase his abilities, as he garnered 222 carries in 2016 and 223 carries in 2015. Joe Mixon will come in and steal a lot of work right away, though Hill may still get a majority of the goal-line work, as he's scored 29 rushing touchdowns over the last three years, which is tied for the most in the NFL over that span."
"153","Rex Burkhead","NE","RB52","9","There were plenty of fantasy players going overboard in their love for Burkhead after he totaled 119 yards and two touchdowns on 27 carries in the final week of 2016, saying he was the best free agent running back on the market. Signing with New England didn't quiet those who adored him, though the signing of Mike Gillislee did, as did the extension for James White. Burkhead may be talented, but he's buried on a team that will use a different running back every week. He very well could be the new Brandon Bolden. He's a better best-ball target in case he does indeed see 8-10 touches per week."
"154","Latavius Murray","MIN","RB53","9","Despite finishing as the No. 13 running back in 2016, Murray wasn't very good, hence the reason the Raiders let him walk to sign a 31-year-old retired running back. Going from the Raiders offensive line that's ranked top-three in the NFL to the Vikings offensive line that ranks among the five worst was already a problem, but then he had foot surgery, and the Vikings traded up to draft Dalvin Cook in the second round. It's likely that Murray has seen his final days of fantasy relevance."
"155","Shane Vereen","NYG","RB54","8","The Giants are said to have major plans for Vareen. Whether that means he is a quality third-down pass catcher or somehow who also sees 100 touches is yet to be determined, but he is worth keeping an eye on."
"156","Jamaal Williams","GB","RB55","8","Williams is a running back built for a workhorse role, as evidenced by his seven games with 24 or more carries with BYU last year. While Ty Montgomery may be a fine converted running back, Williams was built to carry a load. Williams is a dark horse candidate to be 2017's version of Jordan Howard."
"157","Alvin Kamara","NO","RB56","5","The Saints backfield has been top-five in fantasy points over the last five years, so when looking at a running back like Kamara this late in drafts, it should get you excited. He's immediately the best receiving option out of the backfield, which should see an extended role with the Brandin Cooks departure."
"158","Jamaal Charles","DEN","RB57","5","Sadly, this may be the end for J.C. He hasn't really 'played' in a year-and-a-half, and when he did, he wasn't the same player. After attempting to return from his second torn ACL, Charles wound up having to get both of his knees cleaned out towards the end of last season. He's still not participating in OTA's, so it's very likely that Devontae Booker beats him out for the change-of-pace role behind C.J. Anderson. Even if he sticks, he'll likely max out at 8-10 touches per game."
"159","Antonio Gates","LAC","TE20","9","I'll be the first to admit that we all might have the 37-year-old Gates too low on our lists, but everything is going against him here. They not only drafted his replacement Hunter Henry last year, but he proved to be ready to take over the main role. Gates is likely coming back to secure the all-time record for touchdowns among tight ends, as he needs just one more to break the record."
"160","Minnesota Vikings","","DST5","9","The Vikings' defense was incredible to start the season, but let's not be so quick to forget how they finished the season. They should still be regarded as an upside option, but not one drafted with the elite DST units."
"161","Kenny Stills","MIA","WR59","11","It'd be natural to expect a regression for Stills, as most are expecting Devante Parker to come out of his shell this year, but the Dolphins did spend a lot of money to keep Stills in place. He also happened to get better as the year went on in 2016, finishing with 9.5 or more standard fantasy points in seven of the last 10 games. He's a volatile option, but you can definitely do worse than him for a bye week option."
"162","Arizona Cardinals","","DST6","8","Patrick Peterson and the Honey Badger are a fearsome combo. This defense should again be drafted as a top 5 unit."
"163","Marqise Lee","JAC","WR60","8","It's hard to argue with the Lee supporters about his 2016 campaign which netted just 32 fewer yards and three touchdowns than his teammate Allen Robinson, and that's despite seeing 46 targets less than him. Lee was actually drafted before Robinson in 2014 but hasn't been able to stay healthy, missing 9 games in his first two years. There may be something here, and if you think there is, you'll need to move Allen Robinson down your list."
"164","Robert Woods","LAR","WR61","8","He was extremely inefficient in his time with the Bills, but he did flash in a few games last season, leading the Rams to pony up some dough this offseason. It'll be interesting to see how they use him after drafting slot receiver Cooper Kupp at the start of the third round."
"165","Breshad Perriman","BAL","WR62","10","As discussed earlier in this article, the Ravens threw the ball more than any other team in 2016 and they lost 151 of their targets to wide receivers this off-season (Steve Smith and Kamar Aiken). Perriman may never live up to the expectations some set for him, but he may be a WR3 on volume alone in 2017."
"166","Kenny Golladay","DET","WR63","7",""
"167","Cooper Kupp","LAR","WR64","8","The wide receiver who Steve Smith said would've been the No. 1 on his board in this year's draft. Going to play with Jared Goff may be one of the best things, as he needs a receiver who can run the routes over the middle of the field and build his confidence. It'll be interesting to see if Robert Woods gets the nudge over him to start the season."
"168","DeAndre Washington","OAK","RB58","10","This time last year, most thought that Washington could be one of the biggest steals in drafts. The odd part about him falling down draft boards is that he actually played really well in his rookie season, averaging 5.4 yards per carry, and showing elusiveness on his receptions. If something were to happen to the 31-year-old Marshawn Lynch, Washington might just turn out to be one of the biggest steals in 2017 drafts."
"169","New England Patriots","","DST7","9","Just by the benefit of playing ahead, the Patriots should see plenty more turnovers and sacks fall into their lap. If only they hadn't traded their two best defensive players."
"170","Joe Flacco","BAL","QB21","10","The addition of Jeremy Maclin saved Flacco from throwing to Mike Wallace and Breshad Perriman as his starting wide receivers. Not that Wallace isn't solid, but he's not a No. 1, and Perriman hasn't shown anything to suggest he's ready for a full-time role. Look for Maclin and newly acquired running back Danny Woodhead to be favorites of Flacco. The Ravens have led the league in pass attempts over the last two years, but Flacco has just one game with more than 24 fantasy points in that span. He's a safe No. 2 quarterback in 2QB leagues, but not much more."
"171","O.J. Howard","TB","TE21","11","Labeled as the most pro-ready tight end to come out of the NFL Draft in a long time, Howard landed on a Bucs team that apparently still wants to use last year's breakout tight end Cameron Brate. He'll get snaps, but on a team with so many targets in the passing game, it's better to just pass in year-one."
"172","Stephen Gostkowski","NE","K1","9","Kickers are so volatile from year to year, but over the past 5 years, no one has been close to Gostowski."
"173","Justin Tucker","BAL","K2","10","Tucker was phenomenal last year, but it is entirely dependant on opportunities. He should be regarded as a top kicker, but isn't worth drafting until the last round."
"174","Blake Bortles","JAC","QB22","8","Regardless of what you've heard, Bortles has finished as a top-10 quarterback in each of the last two seasons. With that being said, he has a new head coach who wants to run the ball. They brought in Leonard Fournette to do just that, so not only will you see a decrease in Bortles' overall pass attempts, but you'll also see a decline in his rushing output, which has been better than most think. He's a streamer in 2017."
"175","Charles Sims","TB","RB59","11","One of the most unpredictable players of the last three years, Sims has averaged just 2.8 and 2.9 yards per carry in two of three seasons, but looked like a different player in between when he averaged 4.9 yards per carry in 2015 and added 51 receptions for 561 yards and four touchdowns under Dirk Koetter. He looks to have lost the backup job to Jacquizz Rodgers, but if he wasn't healthy for all of last season, there may still be hope. He should still have a passing down role when Doug Martin returns from suspension, while Rodgers likely won't."
"176","Sam Bradford","MIN","QB23","9","Bradford was extremely accurate last season and this is the first time in his career he'll have the same offensive coordinator in back to back seasons. His receiving core, offensive line and running game should all be improved as well, so don't be surprised when he improves upon his QB #22 performance from 2016."
"177","Jared Cook","OAK","TE22","10",""
"178","Evan Engram","NYG","TE23","8","If you're unaware of what type of tight end Engram is, I'll tell you this... He's a wide receiver with a tight end tag, similar to the way Aaron Hernandez was with the Patriots. When watching Engram, he looks similar to Jordan Matthews, a big slot receiver. This is an issue because he'll be competing for snaps with sophomore Sterling Shepard. He also doesn't block well, which doesn't bode well for his ability to stay on the field in 11 personnel."
"179","Dion Lewis","NE","RB60","9","At this point, Lewis figures to see several huge games and a whole lot of busts. He is worth owning in deeper leagues, but unless someone ahead of him goes down with an injury, he is a lottery ticket every week."
"180","J.J. Nelson","ARI","WR65","8",""
"181","John Ross","CIN","WR66","6","Ross is one of the receivers who falls victim to the small, fast wide receiver prejudice. The crazy part is that he's much more than that, though he may not get to showcase his talents in year-one. The Bengals offensive line is a problem, but Ross will stretch the field for the rest of the passing game options. Expect him to have a few games that make you want more, but it's unlikely he's a weekly contributor in 2017."
"182","Marlon Mack","IND","RB61","11","If you're looking for a high-upside pick towards the end of your draft, Mack fits the bill. He is lightning-in-a-bottle, while Frank Gore and Robert Turbin are more like a light drizzle at this point in time. If he gets the opportunity to start at any point in the season, you can pencil Mack in as an RB2, regardless of opponent. The offense is built for a player like him, and it's what they've been missing over the last few years, a running back who can make splash plays."
"183","Charles Clay","BUF","TE24","6","Labeling him as a sleeper feels right, as most don't realize Clay totaled 209 yards and four touchdowns in his final three games with Tyrod Taylor. All of those games took place in the fantasy playoffs, which is why I figured there'd be more attention on him in early drafts. If you're looking for an upside tight end late in drafts, Clay could be your guy."
"184","Taylor Gabriel","ATL","WR67","5","There was a lot of splash plays for Gabriel in 2016, but expecting that to continue may be a recipe for disaster. Matt Ryan's touchdown rate was north of 7 percent in 2016, which was almost double of what it's been in previous years. Gabriel saw 7 targets that were thrown 20 or more yards in the air, while the rest of the Falcons receivers saw 45 of those targets. Gabriel scored 3 touchdowns, which was equal to everyone else's combined. Regression is coming to a player who saw just under five targets per game with the Falcons."
"185","Mohamed Sanu","ATL","WR68","5","His first year in Atlanta was a mixed bag, and while he was injured throughout some of it, waiver addition Taylor Gabriel made an even bigger impact. Sanu totaled 10.7 or more fantasy points in three of his first eight games with the team, but failed to score more than 9.2 points the remainder of the season. Gabriel is in for some regression, so maybe Sanu winds up on the receiving end of that."
"186","Matt Bryant","ATL","K3","5","The Falcons scored 120% more than the worst offense in football last year--that is total dominance. Granted, Shanahan is gone now, but Bryant is still a good bet to have all kinds of scoring opportunities again."
"187","Dan Bailey","DAL","K4","6",""
"188","Carolina Panthers","","DST8","11","The Panthers plugged some holes in their secondary this off-season and will hopefully have a healthy Keuchley, which should play a major role in restoring them as a top 12 fantasy defense this year."
"189","Allen Hurns","JAC","WR69","8","When Hurns came onto the scene in 2014, everyone was surprised when he posted over 100 yards and two touchdowns in Week 1. He was wildly inconsistent that season, but really came on in 2015 when Bortles finished as the No. 4 quarterback. While Bortles declined, so did Hurns. Not just that, but Marqise Lee made a name for himself. In games with Lee on the field over his career, Hurns averaged 1.4 fewer targets per game. Keep in mind that the Jags will be throwing less in 2017 as well."
"190","David Njoku","CLE","TE25","9","It's rare for a rookie tight end to make an impact, but if there's one to bet on this year, it's Njoku. Immediately after drafting him, the Browns cut Gary Barnidge, leaving only Njoku and sophomore Seth DeValve on the roster. He's not much of a blocker just yet, so he should be running a lot of routes when he is on the field."
"191","Jonathan Williams","BUF","RB62","6","Last season, the Bills offensive-line was by far the most efficient in the NFL and wouldn't you know it, they led the NFL with 28 rushing touchdowns. Now that Gillislee is gone, it should be Williams' turn to step into double-digit goal-line opportunities and plenty of carries in the run-heavy scheme."
"192","Joe Williams","SF","RB63","11",""
"193","Jay Cutler","MIA","QB24","11","Who would've thought we'd be blessed with Cutler's presence so quickly? Returning to Adam Gase's offense is huge, as it was arguably Cutler's most efficient season as a pro. He threw 21 touchdowns and 11 interceptions while his top wide receivers that year were Alshon Jeffery who missed 7-plus games, Josh Bellamy, and Marc Mariani. His WR corps in Miami is one of the better trios in the league, making Cutler a solid QB2 in fantasy."
"194","New York Giants","","DST9","8","The Giants are positively loaded with talent on the defensive side. They have substantial upside this year, but we haven't seen them put it all together quite yet so don't draft them soely on the upside."
"195","D'Onta Foreman","HOU","RB64","7","Landing behind Lamar Miller may have been the best thing for someone like Foreman, as Miller seems to be a player who is best suited for a timeshare. Foreman is also a bigger back who could see goal-line duties right away, as Miller was one of just two running backs to score fewer than six rushing touchdowns with at least 215 carries (Frank Gore was the other)."
"196","Devin Funchess","CAR","WR70","11","There are a lot of people doubting Kelvin Benjamin this off-season, but they aren't thinking about what that'd mean for the rest of the offense, and in particular, Funchess. Not only did Benjamin struggle down the stretch, but both Ted Ginn and Corey Brown left via free agency, freeing up 148 targets in the offense. While most think rookies will make up for most of that, Funchess himself has caught nine touchdowns on just 121 career targets and has a healthy 15.7 yards per reception."
"197","Nelson Agholor","PHI","WR71","10","After the Eagles shipped Jordan Matthews away, it seems as though Agholor will get his crack at the starting slot position. Granted, he is dropping everything in site, but there is a route to WR4 type numbers should he win the job."
"198","Mason Crosby","GB","K5","8","When picking a kicker, it helps to have one with the best quarterback in the history of the NFL. Crosby should have plenty of scoring chances again this season and can hit the long field goal too."
"199","Jalen Richard","OAK","RB65","10",""
"200","Alex Smith","KC","QB25","10","It's official, we are on Patrick Mahomes watch in Kansas City. I'm kidding, kind of. After defending Smith as the starting quarterback the entire offseason, the Chiefs felt it necessary to trade up in the first round to select Mahomes, the quarterback of the future. At this point in his career, we know what Smith is and what he isn't. It appears the Chiefs know that, too."
"201","Tavon Austin","LAR","WR72","8","Austin was the No. 23 wide receiver just two years ago. Crazy, right? Now under the youngest coach of all-time Sean McVay, we have someone who won't be afraid to go outside the box with a player like Austin. Old school guys are stuck in their ways, but McVay would be willing to adapt, and considering Austin is costing them $22 million over the next two years, you can say they need to get the most out of him. He's an excellent late-round flier."

"203","Chris Hogan","NE","WR73","9","Will he go away now that Brandin Cooks is on the team, or will Malcolm Mitchell see the biggest decline in snaps? Hogan won't be an every week starter, but he is going to have big games from time to time."
"204","Zach Miller","CHI","TE26","9","Miller missed 6 weeks last season, but in terms of points per game, he outscored both Martellus Bennett and Eric Ebron, who are being drafted as TE1s. The Bears' tight end was phenomenal to close the 2015 season as well so don't sleep on him as a potential surprise piece this season."
"205","Austin Seferian-Jenkins","NYJ","TE27","11","Supposedly over his off-the-field issues, Seferian-Jenkins is now considered a team leader for the Jets. Talent was never the question with him, so it's possible that he's still too low on the list. The fact that the Jets are as bad as they are, and Seferian-Jenkins still has to serve a two-game suspension, he's best left on the waiver wire in most leagues."
