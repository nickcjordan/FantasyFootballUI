Mitch Trubisky","Much like Mahomes - Trubisky is going to be a popular sleeper at the quarterback position next season. The Bears made him a lot more attractive based on several moves - including the addition of a No. 1 wideout in Allen Robinson - a speedster in Taylor Gabriel and an intriguing tight end in Trey Burton. This doesn't guarantee that he'll be drafted at what is a very deep position - but Trubisky has some definite fantasy upside now.
Patrick Mahomes","Mahomes was a big winner when the Chiefs announced that Alex Smith was being traded to the Washington Redskins. He won even more when they added Sammy Watkins as a free agent. That gives the big-armed quarterback a valuable deep threat in a pass attack that also has Travis Kelce and Tyreek Hill - and Kareem Hunt coming out of the backfield. Mahomes will now be one of the better fantasy sleepers at his position.
Rex Burkhead","When Lewis left for Tennessee - it made Burkhead a much more interesting fantasy option in 2018. While the team also added Jeremy Hill - Burkhead is closer in skill set to Lewis and projects to see an increase in touches in his absence. Burkhead scored eight times in 10 games a season ago - and his tools as a pass-catcher make him a solid PPR option. He's a player to watch during the summer months.
Robert Woods","Woods is coming off the best fantasy season of his career - posting 781 yards and five touchdowns despite missing four games due to injuries. With Sammy Watkins now in Kansas City - the USC product should expect to see a bigger target share in what was one of the best offensive attacks in the NFL a season ago. Cooper Kupp and Josh Reynolds also figure to see more chances - but Woods is the Rams wideout to grab.
Russell Wilson","The top-scoring player in fantasy football last season - Wilson has lost Graham (Packers) and Paul Richardson (Redskins) to free agency. Those two players alone contributed 173 targets - or 42 percent of all the wide receiver/tight end targets on the team a season ago. While I don't expect Wilson's value to tumble too far - losing these two players (plus a boatload of defenders) is still going to hurt next season.
Stefon Diggs","Diggs is coming off the best season of his career - as he finished 19th in PPR points among wide receivers despite missing two games. He should be able to improve on that finish in 2018 - as the addition of Kirk Cousins makes Diggs - Thielen and everyone on the Vikings offense more attractive on some level. If Diggs can stay on the field for a full 16-game season - 1000-plus yards is possible for this talented wideout.
Wayne Gallman","Gallman was a useful flex starter for PPR owners at the end of last season - rankings 22nd at his position over the final four games. Unfortunately - he's unlikely to retain a larger role in the Giants offense after the addition of veteran Jonathan Stewart. You also have to figure that the team will address the running back position in the NFL draft (maybe Saquon Barkley) - so Gallman's arrow seems to be pointing down.
