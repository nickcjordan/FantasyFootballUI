Andy Dalton","Unfortunately, quarterback ADP doesn't move significantly one way or another, but the fact that Dalton has finished as a top-12 quarterback for three of the last five seasons will catch on. He's got better weapons than he's ever had and he's never finished worse than the QB18, so you do the math.
Brandin Cooks","Cooks as WR12 is just too high for me. I understand that the situation in New England is exciting, but he was already playing with an elite quarterback in a better passing offense that saw more volume. So why are we suddenly assuming he’s in a BETTER situation? Drew Brees and Tom Brady are both quarterbacks who spread the ball around, but the Saints called pass 63.4 percent of the time (5th), while New England called pass 56.4 percent of the time (27th). Now there is more competition for targets, and since 2011, the Patriots have had just one wideout to post 1,100 yards and eight or more touchdowns.
Carlos Hyde","It's not much of a bump, but it's something. All drafters are going off right now is reports from beat writers. New head coach Kyle Shanahan himself has said that scheme is overrated and that Hyde hasn't showed everything he's capable of. :: There has been talk of cutting him
Christian McCaffrey","I love the guy’s talent and I see the upside in PPR leagues, but in standard leagues, I think he’s being over drafted. He could eventually be a stud, but as things stand he’s still behind Jonathan Stewart, and Cam Newton is still going to run the ball. I’m not saying he doesn’t hold value or can’t be useful, but I think people will be a little disappointed in his rookie season.
Coby Fleener","It won't go up as much as it probably should, considering a lot of people were burned by drafting Fleener as a top-six tight end last year. It'd probably shock you to know that he finished as the No. 12 tight end, right? The Saints didn't do anything to take away targets from him. In fact, they gave away Brandin Cooks and brought in Ted Ginn, who isn't going to take any targets away from the middle of the field, where Fleener does his work. He's not great, but he also doesn't have to be in order to move up.
Cooper Kupp","Only take as a last round option if nothing better -- heard people talk about his potential
David Johnson","2016 Started with a lot of runs, part of the way through he shifted heavily to receiving
Devante Parker","All we heard last off-season was how the coaches weren't impressed with Parker, so when you hear those same coaches praising him uncontrollably this off-season, you should take notice. Jarvis Landry's targets went down as the season went on and should continue to do so in 2017.
Devin Funchess","With reports coming out about Kelvin Benjamin's weight and conditioning being an issue, it's surprising to see Funchess this far down the list. If Benjamin's 2016 struggles leak into 2017, Funchess should have no trouble taking over Ted Ginn's role, which saw 96 and 95 targets the last two years.
Duke Johnson","If something happens to Crowell, borderline RB1. Good pickup for someone cheap, has a lot of upside
Eddie Lacy","Rawls and Procise may take touches -- beware of a committee
Ezekiel Elliott","POSSIBLE 2 GAME SUSPENSION, Lost two of his O-linemen
Hunter Henry","Gates is still a factor on the team
Jack Doyle","I'd like to take full responsibility for Doyle's skyrocketing up the charts. I'm joking, of course. But seriously, I'm responsible. He was at No. 19 when I wrote this article back at the end of March, stating that he was grossly undervalued. He's closer to where he should be now, but there's still room to ascend.
Jameis Winston","We’ve seen mostly flashes to this point, but Winston is a gamer who is really starting to get it. We saw glimpses of it the past two years but with D-Jax and O.J. Howard added to the mix, I think 2017 is where Winston really takes off. He’s a top-10 threat.
James White","This one won't get out of hand because he's a Patriots running back after all, but to see White down as the 46th running back off the board is nonsense. He finished as the No. 35 running back in standard and No. 26 in PPR. After the playoff run, the Patriots invested more into him than they have any running back in years, and rightfully so.
Jamison Crowder","Crowder is the perfect example of the media hype generating value when we look back at the 2016 season. The Redskins took Josh Doctson in the first round and he received all the attention while Crowder went on to garner 99 targets. Over 74% of his targets came from the slot and he took advantage as he racked up 847 yards receiving. Washington ran over 730 plays in 3WR sets in 2016 so the opportunity should remain. Meanwhile, both DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon have moved on to other teams leaving Crowder as the top returning receiver. Terrelle Pryor is turning heads in camp, but don’t be surprised if Crowder is the top PPR target in Washington in 2017. Feel free to grab him 10 WR spots later in PPR ADP and rub it in to your league-mate who bit on the Pryor hype and didn’t get value.
Jarvis Landry","All I’ve been hearing this offseason from fantasy experts is how committed DeVante Parker is, he sees his opportunity to cash in on his talents, he’s the Dolphins’ top talent. Let’s make one thing clear, Landry is the top athlete and trusted target on the Miami roster.  Landry has 204 receptions and 2,293 yards in the last two seasons compared to Parker’s 82 receptions and 1,238 yards. In 2016, Landry was targeted 85 times from the slot resulting in 856 yards and four touchdowns. His average air yardage on targets was only 6.6 yards but netted 12.5 yards per reception, slippery as they come. There may not be a better slot receiver in the NFL. Add the fact that Miami ran 682 plays in 3WR sets last year (75% of all plays) and you’ve got the perfect intersection of volume, trust, and talent. Sure, Parker and Stills will have some flashy big plays, but Landry will be the top PPR Miami receiver at year’s end.
Jeremy Maclin","This may take some time to catch up, but he's being undervalued as of right now. While Joe Flacco has never produced a top-15 wide receiver, he has produced a top-32 wide receiver every year (has actually produced a top-25 receiver in all but one, which was when Steve Smith got hurt in 2015). Maclin is easily the best wide receiver on this team.
Joe Mixon","The needle has already started to move for Mixon, who was being drafted in the 10th round at the start of May. He's a prime example of why you want to draft sooner rather than later. The only way they'll quiet the media is to let his play do the talking. It's also rumored that Gio Bernard may not be ready at the start of the season. :: May not be a starter until week 3
John Brown","Easily my favorite value in early drafts. This is me planting my flag on Brown before the hype gets out of control. He's healthy and should return to the WR2 conversation that he was a part of in 2015.
Julio Jones","Getting old, but still good
Kareem Hunt","May take over starting job by the time the season starts
Kirk Cousins","What in the world does Cousins have to do in order to get the respect he deserves in fantasy leagues? He barely cracks the top-100 picks and his ADP is tied with Ben Roethlisberger for QB10. That’s absurd. Among quarterbacks who’ve thrown a minimum of 450 passes since the start of the 2015 season, Cousins ranks fourth in passing yards (9.083), third in completion percentage (68.32%), tied for 12th in touchdown passes (54), sixth in Quarterback Rating (99.3), fifth in yards gained per pass attempt (7.91), sixth in adjusted yards gained per pass attempt (7.94), and seventh in passing yards per game (283.8), according to Pro-Football-Reference. Pro Football Focus (PFF) gave him the ninth highest overall grade at quarterback, and he ranked third in DYAR (1,317), fifth in DVOA (20.9%), and sixth in QBR (71.7), per Football Outsiders (FO). Traditional statistics and advanced measures are in agreement that Cousins is a stud, and the Big Three of Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady, and Drew Brees are the only quarterbacks who I’d rank clearly ahead of him this season. That’s not to say he’ll definitely be the fourth highest scoring quarterback this season, but that’s a rank that’s within reach. He’s a better value at his ADP than the likes of Andrew Luck (63.0), Matt Ryan (69.2), and Russell Wilson (78.0). He’d be a better value selected a full round earlier than his ADP in 10-team or 12-team leagues, too. Furthermore, it’s mind boggling that Jameis Winston (89.8), Cam Newton (94.8), and Marcus Mariota (95.1) are being selected in front of him, even with the value they add with their legs.
Leonard Fournette","If he is going to be a catching back, I like him. However he was not this way in college.
Marcus Mariota","Mariota’s ADP is currently in the top 10 and it should be. His consistency ranked him #8 last season and the Titans added more weapons in the passing game for 2017. Buy the hype, he’s worth it!
Mark Ingram","Do not take Ingram unless he is a very late pick. He still could lose his job to Peterson
Marlon Mack","We’re going to call this one a homer pick if you like. I am very interested in seeing what happens with rookie running back in the Colts’ offense. The Colts have a number of question marks after overhauling a good chunk of their roster in the offseason. The biggest question mark is surrounding whether Andrew Luck will be on the field to start the season and then what that offense will look like. Luck is a playmaker and the passing game will continue to produce, but where the Colts struggle the most is in the run game. Sure, the aging Frank Gore reached 1,000 yards on the ground in 2016, but he isn’t going to be breaking big plays. This is where Mack becomes and intriguing piece of the team’s backfield. He’s an excellent receiver out of the backfield and can make defenders miss in space. He could be the big play back who can fit in that joker role that the Colts have been needing. It’s still early in training camp and he is an untested rookie. But, at RB59 in the consensus rankings, Mack could be a late round gem.
Marshawn Lynch","Lynch strikes me as a guy who is currently being overvalued by the fantasy football community. With recent news of the Raiders trying to cap the Skittles man at 200 touches, the prognosis is now much darker. Being drafted 24th overall and as the 12th running back, the pride of Oakland, CA is seemingly being drafted at his ceiling with no concern for his downside after being out of the league for a year and struggling the season prior to his brief retirement. Latavius Murray finished as RB13 in this offense last year, but even he received 228 touches last season. ADP point expectations for the RB12 draft slot over the last four seasons is 172.9 points. To reach that threshold, at 170 carries even at his career best 5.0 yards per carry, with 30 receptions at his best 10.2 yards per catch average, Marshawn would have to score ten touchdowns to meet his point expectations. All of that is at his career bests, imagine for a second that Lynch is more average than the beast mode we remember.
Martavis Bryant","Rightfully so, people want to see Bryant re-inserted into the starting lineup, but it's already happened. He's being drug-tested twice a week and appears to be on the up-and-up. His talent could carry him beyond my guess at his ADP.
Mike Evans","Evans will not give you the consistency that you need from a first round pick. His ADP of WR4 / pick 7 overall is absurd! He ranked 13th in consistency last year and there are more weapons in Tampa this year, so don’t be that guy.
Mike Gillislee","I’ve been pounding the table for drafting this duo all offseason, and while I didn’t discuss them specifically with DRAFT leagues in mind, the info in this piece from early July is pertinent for understanding my infatuation with Gillislee and Burkhead. I’ll spare myself the work of using the same numbers to illustrate how good both of these backs are. Instead I’ll point out more proof of their excellence in 2016 I stumbled upon. Warren Sharpe is one of the most well respected football numbers guys in the business, and I’ve been familiar with his work for years. Only recently, however, have I discovered his advanced stats website with a treasure trove of information available for free. Turning attention back to New England’s duo of talented runners, they were two of the most successful red-zone runners in the NFL last year as you can see here. Among backs who had at least 10 carries in the red zone, Burkhead ranked sixth in Successful Play Rate (64%), and Gillislee was far and away the leader with a 94% mark (next closest was Derrick Henry at 77%). Less talented runner LeGarrette Blount led the league with 18 rushing touchdowns last year, and since 2015, he’s tied with David Johnson for the league lead with 24. Expecting one back in the backfield to duplicate Blount’s 18 rushing touchdowns is probably too ambitious, but if you set sights at the average of his last two years of 12 rushing touchdowns, that’s more realistic with an even greater ceiling still possible. As a backup running back for the Bills, Gillislee managed to rank tied for 15th at running back in rushing touchdowns since 2015 with 11. Now the likely lead runner for his new club’s stable of backs and tied to a higher-octane offense, the touchdown scoring should be plentiful. Don’t mistake Gillislee for a back who’s completely reliant on touchdowns for value. Among backs who’ve carried the ball a minimum of 100 times since 2015, his 5.7 yards per attempt is the most, and if you set the threshold a little lower to only 80 carries, he’s second to Ty Montgomery (5.89) — who I also love in DRAFT leagues, but he’s more fairly priced at an ADP of 36.9. Gillislee is RB18 in DRAFT league ADP.  At the same cost, I’d rather have Gillislee than Christian McCaffrey, Joe Mixon, and Isaiah Crowell at minimum, and all three are being selected before New England’s new weapon in the backfield. Furthermore, I’d rather turn my attention to others in the ADP range of Devonta Freeman (10.9), Todd Gurley (23.9), Lamar Miller (26.1), and Marshawn Lynch (29.6), and reach as many as 10-12 picks higher than Gillislee’s ADP in order to secure his rights and offset passing on that quartet of backs. Burkhead’s laughably underrated and a great handcuff or standalone pick who should be flirting with a top-150 ADP as opposed to slipping to a fringe top-200 pick.
Mike Wallace","I was not a fan of Wallace entering last year and thought the signing by the Ravens was foolish. He was terrible in 2015 with the Vikings, and that followed an underwhelming two-year stint with the Dolphins. Even Wallace’s final year in Pittsburgh (2012) wasn’t inspiring. He hadn’t bested 1,000 yards receiving since 2011, the second of back-to-back 1,000-plus yard receiving seasons. Wallace did show an aptitude for finding pay dirt even in some down years hauling in eight in 2012, five in 2013, and 10 in 2014. I was wrong about Wallace’s tank being empty, and last year, he was targeted 116 times and caught 72 passes for 1,017 yards and four touchdowns. He and quarterback Joe Flacco were on the same page, and Wallace ranked second on the team in targets, receptions, and receiving touchdowns while leading the team in receiving yards. The team leaders in each of those other categories — Dennis Pitta in targets and receptions and Steve Smith in receiving touchdowns — are no longer in the mix this year, lessening the concern about the additions of Jeremy Maclin and Danny Woodhead and the possibility of Breshad Perriman taking a step forward this year. Wallace should be viewed as the best option in Baltimore’s passing attack, and Baltimore led the NFL in pass attempts last year. I don’t expect the Ravens to lead the NFL in passing attempts again this year, but Wallace’s perch atop the receiving options in Baltimore makes for a nice get at his cheap cost.
Paul Perkins","His situation is eerily similar to that of Devonta Freeman heading into the 2015 season. When Perkins is the starter in pre-season, you'll see him shoot up boards, as he's a three-down running back on what should be a top-10 scoring offense.
Pierre Garcon","This is much better from where it was two months ago, where he was being drafted in the 13th round. He's going to settle somewhere in the WR3 range, because that is where his floor is in the new 49ers offense, though his ceiling isn't much higher. :: Garcon’s very good, and he doesn’t get the credit he deserves. He downgrades offenses going from the Redskins to the 49ers, but he offsets that by being the No. 1 pass-catching option by a wide margin. I gushed about Garcon in the middle of last month, and you can read that here. I also talked about him as a compelling option as part of an extremely cheap stack with Brian Hoyer. There’s no reason for me to re-write the same advanced stats that illustrate how good Garcon was last year, and instead I’ll turn my attention to more stats that showcase Ga Among all receivers and tight ends since 2015, Garcon ranks 26th in receptions (151) and 23rd in receiving yards (1,818) while reeling in nine touchdown receptions, per Pro-Football-Reference. Gillislee isn’t the only player in this piece who I dug up more intriguing stats for at Sharp Football Stats. That site has a measure called TOARS which is an acronym for target and output adjusted receiving success. Last year, among receivers who were targeted at least 50 times, Garcon ranked 20th in TOARS. Garcon’s an excellent value by traditional statistical measures and advanced metrics, too.
Samaje Perine","Similar to Mixon, Perine was way down at the start of May's ADP in the 13th round. Reports have come out that Perine looks great and continues to impress the coaches. Opposite of wide receivers, a running back's age doesn't matter when looking for breakout candidates.
Sammy Watkins","Fantasy owners want to see him healthy, plain and simple. As soon as he breaks a long play in the pre-season displaying he's healthy, Watkins will shoot up into WR1 territory.
Stefon Diggs","Did you know Diggs was the No. 14 wide receiver in PPR points per game despite being hurt for much of the year? Not to mention he did that while both Kyle Rudolph and Adam Thielen got theirs. I'm making it my personal goal to raise Diggs' ADP into the 20's, because that's where it should be.
Terrelle Pryor","Pryor has been one of the most polarizing players in fantasy, and the hype is real. However, I’m okay with it. Last year, he caught passes from six different quarterbacks and still posted 77/1,041/4, while 27 percent of his passes were deemed off target. Now he’s in Washington with one of the best aerial attacks in the league, while over 35 percent of their targets from last year need replacing.
Todd Gurley","Has a new coach, may have value if you can grab him in the second round
Ty Montgomery","Montgomery is deserving of all the hype we can throw at him. In his first full season as a running back, he will show that all the hype we throw his way is worth it. The underlying metrics for Montgomery are off the charts. He is in the 91st percentile burst score that measures zero-inertia explosiveness from PlayerProfiler, and it showed as he averaged the sixth best yards per touch in the entire league. We know the converted wide receiver can shine as a pass catcher out of the backfield, but he also shined running from the shotgun formation picking up 347 yards on 53 carries. That’s a 6.5 yard per rush, one of the best marks in the league. 9.1% of Montgomery’s carries went for over 15 yards last season, and he was one of the best runners in the league after contact and at breaking tackles. With Aaron Rodgers throwing the rock, and plentiful weapons on the outside, Montgomery should continue to see light boxes to run through, making him a player completely deserving of the hype.
Tyler Eifert","Over the last two seasons, no tight end has scored more touchdowns than Eifert, and that's despite him missing 11 games. He ranks just 19th in targets over that time, showing just how effective he's been in the red-zone. Once fantasy owners see him healthy, he should move up boards.
Tyreek Hill","Right or wrong, Hill is going to move up boards with the departure of Jeremy Maclin. While I don't believe it has a massive effect on his outlook, the consensus is that he's going to see more playing time, so his natural touchdown regression won't matter much. :: While I loved Tyreek Hill’s emergence in the second half of last season, there is a very good chance that he will be a big disappointment for fantasy owners who are overvaluing him in 2017. Hill found success last year in a particular role. A role in which he had big play opportunities, but he also wasn’t seeing coverage as if he were a team’s No. 1 receiver. With Maclin out the door, the team is left relatively thin at WR and they are expecting Hill to rise to true WR1 stature. He’s going to have to make huge strides to make that happen. In 2016 he saw less than 45% of Kansas City’s offensive snaps and his production was largely based on situational football and making the most out of defensive mismatches. He will have big moments, but I am expecting him to struggle in the role of a No. 1 receiver. Hill is currently ranked #27 in the consensus WR rankings and I’m seeing many people reach for him too high in drafts. Unless Kansas City finds some truly innovative ways to create opportunities for him as their top receiver, I expect Hill to be somewhat of a disappointment in 2017.
Tyrod Taylor","He'll still be undervalued come the start of the season, but the addition of Zay Jones with a healthy Sammy Watkins will bump Taylor's ADP needle as the season nears.
Willie Snead","Most experienced fantasy owners try to get a piece of quality quarterbacks and offenses at discounted prices. In PPR leagues, there may not be a player that fits this description better than Snead. Over the last two years, Snead has accumulated 1,879 yards on 141 catches. New Orleans ran more offensive plays than any other team in the league with 1,104 plays run in 2016, 66% of those in 3WR sets. With Brandin Cooks departed to New England and defenses focused on Michael Thomas, Snead should find plenty of room to operate underneath and build on the relationship he has with the historically indiscriminate Brees. If you’re open, you get the ball. Per Matt Harmon, Snead averaged 3.39 yards of separation on all of his targeted slot routes in 2016. Expect more of the same this year.
