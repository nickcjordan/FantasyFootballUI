"1","David Johnson","ARI","RB1","8","When you see a 25-year-old running back getting 25.8 combined","carries/targets,","it's a given to put him as a clear-cut top","player, especially when","it's a player as talented as Johnson. His goal for this next season is set","at 1,000 rushing and receiving","yards, and","it's well within the realm of","possibilities."
"2","Le'Veon Bell","PIT","RB2","9","If Bell can stay on the field for all 16","games,","it's quite possible that we see him break records.","He's still yet to have a game in his NFL career with fewer than 7.8 PPR points.","There's actually been just three of his 47 games with fewer than 10.9 PPR","points."
"3","Antonio Brown","PIT","WR1","9","It's now four straight seasons where Brown has finished as a top-seven wide","receiver, including two seasons as the No. 1 receiver.","He's","averaged 1,579 yards and 10.8 touchdowns in that","span, and keep in mind that he posted his two best seasons while Martavis Bryant was on the field with","him."
"4","Odell Beckham Jr.","NYG","WR2","8","You're nit-picking when trying to decipher between","Beckham,","Jones, and","Brown, but the area of concern for Beckham is his newfound competition for targets. Brandon Marshall and Evan Engram are going to see","targets, potentially lowering","Beckham's 169 target ceiling from last year.","He's talented enough to make up for the","decrease, but still a tick below Jones and Brown for","me."
"5","Ezekiel Elliott","DAL","RB3","6","There are going to be two new starting offensive lineman in front of","Elliott, but that","shouldn't stop you from taking him as a top-three running back.","He's a virtual lock for 300-350","touches."
"6","Julio Jones","ATL","WR3","5","Losing Kyle Shanahan","isn't going to help a lot of the skill-position","players, but Jones is the exception here. Prior to the 2016","season, Jones averaged 11.8 targets per game from 2013-2015. That number went down to 9.2 targets last year and he missed two","games, yet he still managed to finish as the No. 6 fantasy receiver. If he puts together a complete","season, he could break","records."
"7","LeSean McCoy","BUF","RB4","6","McCoy and the Bills running backs enjoyed a massive 2.56 yards before contact in","2016, which was 0.29 yards more than the next highest team. With Mike Gillislee now in New","England, McCoy should keep his high","workload, even with a new coaching staff in","tow, as well as get a bit more goal-line","work."
"8","Mike Evans","TB","WR4","11","It's fair to say that","Evans' sophomore season with just three touchdowns was an","outlier, as","he's scored 12 in each of his other two seasons. Had he scored his usual 12 touchdowns in","2015, he would have finished as the No. 7 wide receiver. Combine that with his No. 1 finish last year and No. 10 finish in","2014, and you have a safe first-round","pick."
"9","A.J. Green","CIN","WR5","6","Green was dominating in 2016 before going down with a season-ending injury in Week 11. Throughout the first 10 weeks of the","season, Green was the No. 4 fantasy receiver and on pace for","over 1,700 yards and seven touchdowns. In the years he played all 16","games, his finishes are","WR4,","WR4, and WR7. Stay","healthy, A.J."
"10","Melvin Gordon","LAC","RB5","9","Despite averaging a mediocre 4.0 yards per carry heading into his Week 14 matchup where he hurt his","knee, Gordon was sitting as the No. 3 fantasy running back. The Chargers have one of the most difficult passing schedules in the","league, but also have receivers to pull defenders out of the box. Gordon should build on his 2016","season."
"11","Jordy Nelson","GB","WR6","8","It's coming to the point in his career where","he'll take a turn in the wrong","direction, but he","didn't show any signs of that in","2016, finishing with 14 touchdowns. His yardage did slip to the lowest","it's been since","2010 (sans injured","2012), and","it'll likely continue to do","so, but you can bank on double-digit","touchdowns."
"12","Devonta Freeman","ATL","RB6","5","Freeman says he wants to be the highest-paid running back in the","NFL, and","he's got the chance in a contract year. Despite ranking 13th in carries last","year, Freeman totaled the sixth-most fantasy points among running backs. After struggling a bit out of the","gate, Freeman went on to score eight touchdowns in the final six regular season games. With Kyle Shanahan","gone, the Falcons may go back to more of a one-back","system."
"13","Michael Thomas","NO","WR7","5","It was quite the rookie campaign for","Thomas,","totaling 1,137 yards and nine touchdowns in 15","games, and","that's despite not becoming a full-time player until Week 3. In his 13 games as a","starter, Thomas went on a 16-game pace of","101/1,259/11. Brandin Cooks is gone and Ted Ginn is the only wide receiver they replaced him with. Thomas is going to be a WR1 as long as Brees is under","center."
"14","T.Y. Hilton","IND","WR8","11","Did you know that Hilton led the league in receiving yards last","year? He finished with 81 more yards than Odell Beckham","Jr., though he scored just six","touchdowns, which is the reason","he's further down draft boards.","It's now four","straight 1,000-yard seasons for Hilton and Andrew Luck should finally be healthy this","season."
"15","Jay Ajayi","MIA","RB7","11","We","mustn't forget that Ajayi","wasn't even starting ahead of Arian Foster to start 2016 and was so mad about it that he","didn't get to participate in Week 1. He played out of his mind for a few","weeks, but against any defense that","wasn't in the","bottom-eight, he struggled. Some offensive line issues contributed to","that, but expectations should be","tempered, as there are also injury","concerns."
"16","DeMarco Murray","TEN","RB8","8","It was clear that Murray wore down as the season went","on, averaging just 3.5 yards per carry over the final six","weeks, after averaging 4.87 over the first 10 weeks. There was just one game all season in which he","didn't touch the ball at least 16","times, so he should still be a low-end RB1 by","default."
"17","Jordan Howard","CHI","RB9","9","There is concern over his lack of usage in the passing","game, as the Bears signed free agent Benny Cunningham and drafted Tarik","Cohen, who are both pass-game specialists. He finished second in the NFL in rushing","yards, so you have to give him the benefit of the","doubt, but there is some","risk."
"18","Dez Bryant","DAL","WR9","6","He'd be much higher on this list if he","didn't have to go up against the Giants","twice (held him to two catches for 18 yards on 14 targets last","year), Josh Norman","twice,","Broncos,","Cardinals,","Falcons, and Seahawks. The Cowboys","don't have a legit No. 2 receiver to take attention away from","Bryant, but despite","that, he still slides in as my No. 10","receiver."
"19","Doug Baldwin","SEA","WR10","6","He's now finished as a top-10 wide receiver in back-to-back","seasons, and that was despite Russell Wilson taking a slight step back last","year, though it was likely injury-related. His target numbers have gone up four straight","seasons, as have the Seahawks pass attempts. They are attempting to get their run-game going","again, but Baldwin is who moves the","sticks."
"20","Amari Cooper","OAK","WR11","10","The fact that he finished as the No. 12 wide receiver despite catching just five touchdowns and seeing 13 redzone targets says something about his potential. His efficiency spiked in his second year with Derek Carr and Michael Crabtree will be on the wrong side of 30 when the season","starts."
"21","DeAndre Hopkins","HOU","WR12","7","Who","would've thought that","we'd love to have Brian Hoyer back in order to throw to","Hopkins? A year after his","breakout 1,500-yard","season, Hopkins totaled just 954 yards on 151 targets. Those who have high hopes for him are likely depending on rookie quarterback Deshaun Watson taking over in fast","order."
"22","Rob Gronkowski","NE","TE1","9","A game-changer at the toughest position to predict. The gap has gotten a tad smaller from what it used to","be, but Gronkowski had given you","back-to-back 1,100-yard seasons before getting injured in 2016. He gives you an advantage whenever","he's in the lineup and is worth the","risk."
"23","Demaryius Thomas","DEN","WR13","5","Last season was the first one since 2011 where Thomas failed to record at","least 1,300","yards, as he totaled","just 1,083 with Trevor Siemian under center. The Broncos have added Carlos Henderson to the wide receiving","corps, giving another playmaker","who'll garner targets. Thomas is a solid third-round","pick, though he lacks the","upside I'm looking","for."
"24","Todd Gurley","LAR","RB10","8","Call this as me buying into new head coach Sean","McVay's","offense, as","he's said numerous times that his goal is to make Gurley as good as he can be. They added one of the best left tackles in the game this off-season with Andrew","Whitworth, which definitely","doesn't hurt.","He's not the player you thought he","was, but","he's going to get 300-plus","carries."
"25","Allen Robinson","JAC","WR14","8","Betting on","Robinson's talent to shine","through, his targets are likely to decrease this year with the acquisition of Leonard","Fournette, as well as a beefed-up defense. Despite having the exact same number of targets in each of the last two","seasons, Robinson finished with a 517 yard and eight touchdown difference in 2016. There is built-in","risk."
"26","Lamar Miller","HOU","RB11","7","Despite getting all the work he possibly could last","year, Miller disappointed finishing with the sixth-most","carries, but just the 17th most fantasy points among running backs. He misses two","games, but the workload was there. The Texans spent a third-round pick to","acquire D'Onta","Foreman, which adds concern to that workload hanging","around."
"27","Leonard Fournette","JAC","RB12","8","You","don't draft a running back with the No. 4 overall pick and not play him. Fournette is a special player and even though he","isn't a great","receiver, the work will be there for him. I recently did a study on coaching changes and the effect they have on","pass/run games. Everything is going in","Fournette's","favor."
"28","Keenan Allen","LAC","WR15","9","In 27 career games with 10 or less","targets, Allen has averaged just 3.96 receptions and 49.2 yards per","game, compared to the 11 games where","he's seen 11 or more targets and averaged 10.36 receptions and 117.8 yards per game. With all the mouths to","feed,","it's hard to see him getting more than 10 in many","games."
"29","Isaiah Crowell","CLE","RB13","9","What do you get when you mix an average running back with a great offensive","line? An","RB2,","that's Crowell in a nutshell. Most point to his yards per","carry (4.8) being great last","year, but he totaled 48 percent of his rushing yards on just 16 carries. Their offensive line may just be the best in the NFL at this","point, making him an intriguing","option."
"30","Alshon Jeffery","PHI","WR16","10","Battling injuries over the last two seasons where","he's played just 22","games, Jeffery","hasn't been the same without Marc Trestman. If","he's going to live up to his mid-third-round","ADP,","he's going to have to score double-digit","touchdowns."
"31","Travis Kelce","KC","TE2","10","It's possible that the Chiefs finally figured out how to use","Kelce, as he totaled 8.2 targets per game over the final 10 games of the","season, after averaging just 5.9 targets per game over the first 38 games of his career. He finished as the No. 1 tight end while scoring just four touchdowns.","There's still room to","grow."
"32","Brandin Cooks","NE","WR17","9","Most players would see their efficiency go up when heading to the","Patriots, but coming from the Saints and Drew","Brees,","it's unlikely. In a recent study I","did, the Saints wide receivers have totaled 24 WR1 performances over the last three","years, compared to 17 for the Patriots.","He'll have WR1","weeks, but","he'll be frustrating to","own."
"33","Aaron Rodgers","GB","QB1","8","He's a","machine, plain and simple. Year-over-year Rodgers builds his hall of fame","resume, and it translates to","fantasy, considering","he's finished as the No. 1 or No. 2 quarterback in seven of nine","seasons (was also No. 1 before getting hurt in","2013) since taking over for Brett Favre.","There's so much uncertainty around this part of the","rankings,","he's simply a safer","pick."
"34","Davante Adams","GB","WR18","8","From Week 4 on last","season, the only wide receivers to outscore Adams","were: Odell Beckham","Jr., Jordy","Nelson, Antonio","Brown, and Mike Evans. That is it. Nelson will be playing at age-32 this","season."
"35","Sammy Watkins","BUF","WR19","6","There's most definitely some risk built into","Watkins, but","here's the silver-lining. If you were to remove the two games that Watkins played at the start of the 2016","season (foot was still","hurting), here are his last 14 games with Tyrod","Taylor: 110","targets, 67","receptions, 1,236","yards, 9 touchdowns. If you were to carry that pace over 16","games, it would amount to more fantasy points than Antonio Brown scored in","2016."
"36","Golden Tate","DET","WR20","7","After starting the year as a droppable fantasy","asset, Tate totaled 943 yards and four touchdowns over the final 11 games in","2016, which was good enough to be the No. 10 wide receiver in that span. The Lions lost Anquan Boldin and replaced him with a late third-round","rookie."
"37","Tom Brady","NE","QB2","9","While everyone else tries to figure out who","he'll will throw to and which running back will get the majority of the","carries, just take Brady and enjoy your","points."
"38","Michael Crabtree","OAK","WR21","10","There's a good possibility that Crabtree regresses this","season, as he scored 55.7 of his 150 fantasy points on just 23 redzone targets in 2016. That was a far cry from his 13.8 points on 13 targets in","2015."
"39","Jarvis Landry","MIA","WR22","11","Surely lower than","most, I'm expecting Devante Parker to take a step forward in 2017. After averaging nine targets per game over the first 36 games of his","career, Landry averaged just 7.1 targets over the final 12 games under Adam Gase.","He's somewhat safe in PPR","leagues, but","there's not a whole lot of upside","here."
"40","Larry Fitzgerald","ARI","WR23","8","Entering what is likely his last NFL","season, Fitzgerald has now put up","back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons with Carson Palmer behind center. They added Chad Williams via the","draft, but he needs time to develop. The only competition he has for targets over the middle of the field is David Johnson. Fitzgerald was also sixth in redzone targets last year with 23 of","them."
"41","Terrelle Pryor","WAS","WR24","5","He impressed stat-wise in his first full year at wide","receiver, but he also saw 140","targets, which ranked 12th among wide receivers. During his time as the starting","quarterback, Kirk Cousins has not targeted any wide receiver more than 6.9 times per","game, which would equivalate to 110 over a full season.","It's hard to see him finishing better than a low-end","WR2."
"42","Marshawn Lynch","OAK","RB14","10","I understand the want to love Lynch in","Oakland â€"" great running back behind a great offensive","line, and the plodding Latavius Murray scored 12 touchdowns last","year, so why","can't the bruising Lynch.","He's been out of football for a year and a","half, not rehabbing an","injury, but building homes in Haiti.","He's","31-years-old, so keep expectations","realistic."
"43","Carlos Hyde","SF","RB15","11","Don't buy the Joe Williams","hype, even if he was hand-picked by the new regime. So was Tevin","Coleman, but Devonta Freeman was the better player who got the bulk of the work. Hyde has broken 75 tackles over the last two years on just 370 touches and is one of the most elusive backs in the game. His 3.1 yards after contact last year ranked fifth among running backs with at least 100","carries."
"44","Jordan Reed","WAS","TE3","5","The only remaining players Kirk Cousins will have in the offense from last year are Reed and Jamison Crowder. One of them","is 6'2â€, 243","pounds, and a monster in the endzone. His health is always the","concern, which is why","he's a fifth-round pick instead of a third or","fourth."
"45","Christian McCaffrey","CAR","RB16","11","I have my questions about","McCaffrey, but when a team spends a top-10 pick on a running","back,","they're going to use him.","He's worth more in PPR formats considering his receiving","abilities, but","you're also relying on Cam Newton to start throwing to running backs.","There's risk","here, but","there's also","upside."
"46","Joe Mixon","CIN","RB17","6","If we get clarity on Mixon being the starter and workhorse out of the","gate,","he's going to move up on this list. His talent","wasn't ever the","question, and if Gio Bernard","isn't completely healthy by the start of the","season, Mixon could provide RB1","value."
"47","Drew Brees","NO","QB3","5","Just a bit outside of the top-tier of","quarterbacks, Brees is still a set-it-and-forget-it quarterback. Much have been made of his road","splits, but he is","simply â€˜less","great' on the road. Over the last two years on the road he averages 297 passing","yards, 1.73","touchdowns, and 0.93","interceptions, or 17.9 fantasy points per game. That average over 16 games would have been the No. 7 quarterback last year. Not so","bad,","eh?"
"48","Greg Olsen","CAR","TE4","11","Call him","boring, but","he's been a top-four tight end for each of the last three years and","hasn't finished outside of the top-eight since 2011. The concern is that he was just the No. 14 tight end from Week 8 through Week","17."
"49","Ty Montgomery","GB","RB18","8","Despite them drafting two running","backs, Montgomery likely","isn't going anywhere. He offers something in the passing game both Jamaal Williams and Aaron Jones","don't, wide receiver skills. His 5.1 yards after contact was the best in the NFL last","year, though the sample size was","small."
"50","Julian Edelman","NE","WR25","9","When the Patriots traded for Brandin","Cooks, I was legitimately concerned about","Edelman's role going forward. That was until they extended him for another two years. You","can't expect anywhere near the 9.7 targets per game that","he's seen over the last four","years, but","he's obviously part of their plans. He was never a touchdown","scorer, so","it's hard to rely on him as anything more than a low-upside","WR3."
"51","Mark Ingram","NO","RB19","5","Despite playing in a clear timeshare last year where he failed to see more than 18 carries in all but one","game, Ingram finished as the No. 10 running back.","Sure, Peterson is going to steal some","work, probably slightly more than Tim Hightower did. But getting him here as the 20th running back off the board is a","steal."
"52","Emmanuel Sanders","DEN","WR26","5","Did you know","he's now","30-years-old?","He's also the No. 2 receiver on a team that wants to run the ball more in 2017. His year was very up-and-down in 2016 and you should expect more of the same in","2017."
"53","Bilal Powell","NYJ","RB20","11","We really want to get confirmation that","he's going to be the","starter, but all signs point to that being the case. He totaled 411 yards on 82","carries (5.01","YPC) over the last four games of 2016 and was the No. 2 running back over that","time, behind only","Le'Veon","Bell."
"54","Andrew Luck","IND","QB4","11","The last of the quarterbacks you should consider in the top-40","players, Luck is a player who can throw","for 5,000 yards and 40 touchdowns. Prior to hurting his","shoulder, Luck threw","for 4,761 yards and 40","touchdowns, so we","weren't far off. His weapons are arguably as good as","they've ever","been."
"55","Danny Woodhead","BAL","RB21","10","It's tough to figure out where Woodhead fits in at this point of his","career, but","he's going to be fantasy-relevant out of necessity. The Ravens threw the ball more than any other team in the NFL last","year, with the running backs seeing 142 of","them, which was tied for the second-most in the league.","He's an excellent pick in PPR","leagues."
"56","Spencer Ware","KC","RB22","10","There are plenty of rumors coming out of camp that Kareem Hunt could lead the Chiefs","backfield,","though I'm not buying it just yet.","Ware's struggles as the season went on coincided with their top run-blocking guard Parker Ehinger. Ware over the last two","years: 286 carries","for 1,325","yards (4.63","YPC) and 11 total touchdowns.","We'll re-visit this as the season","nears."
"57","Stefon Diggs","MIN","WR27","9","It was an injury-plagued year for Diggs in","2016, as he was either OUT or on the injury report 10 times. When he played through","injuries, he totaled just 4.0 receptions and 37.3 yards per game. When he was off the injury","report, he averaged 9.3 receptions and 107.0 yards per","game."
"58","Tevin Coleman","ATL","RB23","5","Still feels too high for a backup running back who just lost one of the best offensive coordinators in","football, but he does offer splash potential. Had just two games with more than 58 rushing yards in","2016, and touchdowns regression is all but","certain."
"59","Matt Ryan","ATL","QB5","5","Some may say this is too","low, but Ryan","isn't going to repeat his 7.1 percent touchdown","rate, as his previous career-high was 5.2 percent. His yards per attempt was also 1.8 yards more than his previous career-high. Regression is coming for Matty","Ice."
"60","Jamison Crowder","WAS","WR28","5","I wanted to put Crowder higher in my","rankings, but without knocking Terrelle Pryor into low-end WR3","territory, it","wasn't happening. Crowder scored as many touchdowns as DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon combined last","year (7), but still saw fewer targets than the both of them. Love the","player, not necessarily the","situation."
"61","Tyreek Hill","KC","WR29","10","I can understand moving Hill up your list if you draft on upside","alone,","though I'm expecting massive regression with Hill. Not only did he score three special teams","touchdowns, but he also scored nine","rushing/receiving touchdowns on just 85 offensive","touches (one every 9.4","touches). No receiver with more than 45 receptions scored a touchdown more than one every 10.1 targets in","2016, and that was Davante Adams who catches passes from Aaron Rodgers. Outside of Packers","receivers, the next highest was Anquan Boldin at one every 11.9 targets. Hill is still catching passes from Alex Smith the last I","checked,","so I'm not betting on his crazy touchdown per touch ratio happening","again."
"62","C.J. Anderson","DEN","RB24","5","Anderson has averaged a massive 4.56 yards per carry in his","career, while those around him over the last couple of years have totaled a measly 3.90 yards per carry with the team. The Broncos beefed up their offensive line this off-season via free","agency (Former Cowboys guard Ron","Leary) as well as using their first-round pick on tackle Garrett Bolles. The Broncos paid a lot of money to keep Anderson around last","off-season."
"63","Dalvin Cook","MIN","RB25","9","When the Vikings signed Latavius","Murray, most thought they were likely done addressing the position. But once they signed","him, he had foot","surgery, leading the Vikings to trade up and draft Cook. Playing behind one of the worst offensive lines in football will be tough for","anyone, but look for them to give Cook every opportunity to win the starting","job, and I suspect he","will."
"64","Jimmy Graham","SEA","TE5","6","I'm likely lower than","most, but Graham really struggled down the","stretch, even with Russell Wilson coming on. After totaling 89 or more yards in four of the first eight","games, Graham failed to top 67 yards the remainder of the season.","He's still a solid","pick, just not the top-three pick that he always","was."
"65","Russell Wilson","SEA","QB6","6","Despite playing on one leg for a majority of the","season, Wilson still managed to finish as a QB1 in 2016. If you were to get into his game","log,","you'd see that he was a different quarterback over the second-half of the","season, finishing as the No. 4 quarterback from Week 9 through Week","17."
"66","Willie Snead","NO","WR30","5","He's been under-the-radar this","off-season, despite the trade that sent Brandin Cooks away. While they play different","roles, the absence of Cooks clears up 120-plus targets. He may have had the quietest top-35 season ever in 2016. Did you know he finished with more fantasy points than DeAndre","Hopkins?"
"67","Ameer Abdullah","DET","RB26","7","It's been a disappointing career thus","far, but the Lions","didn't add a goal-line back via free agency or the","draft, which tells me that Abdullah will get the first crack at the starting job. Theo Riddick also had surgery on both of his","wrists, which could potentially lead to more work in the passing","game."
"68","Donte Moncrief","IND","WR31","11","Over the last two","seasons, there have been just four games in which both Andrew Luck and Moncrief played in where they","didn't connect for a touchdown. Luck is finally healthy and Moncrief is entering a","contract-year."
"69","Martavis Bryant","PIT","WR32","9","Don't sleep on how good Bryant was when on the","field, as eight of his 21 career games have netted 14 or more standard fantasy","points, including four of them with 20 or more. The Steelers just cut Ladarius","Green, freeing up even more targets than initially","thought."
"70","Pierre Garcon","SF","WR33","11","One of my favorite targets in season-long","leagues, Garcon is going to give you what you pay for. The last season he played under Kyle Shanahan was 2013 when he led the NFL in targets with 182 of them. The 49ers paid him a lot of money to come","there, and","he's legitimately their only starting-caliber","receiver."
"71","Brandon Marshall","NYG","WR34","8","If you want to take away targets from Odell Beckham Jr. in order to get Marshall into WR2","territory, you can take that","venture, but I","won't be on it.","He's entering his age-34 season and he just came off a season where he saw 128","targets, yet finished as the No. 52 receiver. The last time someone saw more than 120 targets and finished outside the top 36 was","2014, where both Vincent Jackson and Andre Johnson accomplished that feat. They are both out of football at this","point."
"72","Theo Riddick","DET","RB27","7","With Ameer Abdullah coming","back, look for Riddick to go back to his change-of-pace role that he had in","2015, where he totaled over 600 yards","receiving, but failed to top seven carries in any game.","He's essentially the Darren Sproles of the Lions","offense, but","younger."
"73","Frank Gore","IND","RB28","11","We","don't know how long","he'll hold onto the","job, seeing as he has averaged just 3.8 yards per carry since coming to the Colts.","He's also scored just 10 touchdowns on the","ground, leading them to use Robert Turbin in goal-line situations last year. They also drafted Marlon","Mack, who could supplant Gore at any","time."
"74","Eddie Lacy","SEA","RB29","6","All weight jokes","aside, Lacy has always been a bigger","guy, but that","didn't stop him from finishing as the No. 6 running back in back-to-back seasons to start his career. The offensive line is a","problem, but it was also a problem in Green","Bay, as the Packers running backs averaged a league-low 1.0 yards before contact in 2016.","We're just looking for RB2 production at this point of","drafts."
"75","Tyler Eifert","CIN","TE6","6","Now has 18 touchdowns over the last two seasons despite playing in just 21 games and being targeted 121 times. No player has a higher touchdown rate over the last two","seasons, including Rob Gronkowski. If it appears","he'll start the season","healthy,","he'll move up this","list."
"76","Kyle Rudolph","MIN","TE7","9","People left the bandwagon too early on","him, myself included. But when you see the chemistry between him and Sam","Bradford, you should be buying in. He saw a position-high 132 targets last","year, including 8.7 per game once offensive coordinator Pat Shurmer took over. Keep in mind that he finished as the No. 3 tight","end, while both Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs got","theirs."
"77","Mike Gillislee","NE","RB30","9","If","there's been one thing Gillislee has been very good","at,","it's running the","football, and particularly well at the goal-line. Over the last two seasons","he's totaled 151.2 fantasy points on 148 carries.","Yeah, and now","he's going to an offense where the guy","he's replacing led the league with 72 redzone carries. Nobody else had more than 59. There is","risk, but","it's well worth","it."
"78","Kirk Cousins","WAS","QB7","5","Since","2014, here is the list of quarterbacks","who've thrown for more yards per attempt than Kirk","Cousins (min. 600","attempts): Ben Roethlisberger and Matt Ryan.","That's it. While he did lose Desean Jackson and Pierre","Garcon, they attempted to right that by acquiring Terrelle Pryor.","He'll also get last","year's first-round pick Josh Doctson on the","field, attempting to take over","Garcon's role in the offense. It may take time to get","acclimated, but Cousins is a back-end","QB1."
"79","Paul Perkins","NYG","RB31","8","After the Giants passed on all free agent running","backs, it appears to be the Perkins show in New York. He was better than perceived at the end of","2016, and will now be on the field with Odell Beckham","Jr., Brandon","Marshall, Sterling","Shepard, and Evan Engram.","He's going to see some light defensive fronts in a high-scoring","offense."
"80","Delanie Walker","TEN","TE8","8","Going from seeing 133 targets in","2015, to just 102 last season is quite the difference for a tight end. The additions of Rishard Matthews and Tajae Sharpe proved to be enough to decrease his","workload, but now","they've added two even better players in Corey Davis and Taywan Taylor.","He'll also be 33-years-old before the season","starts."
"81","Kelvin Benjamin","CAR","WR35","11","He's finished inside the top-20 wide receivers in both seasons","he's","played, but","it's hard to feel confident in","him, knowing that","he's had weight issues for the second-straight off-season. The additions of Christian McCaffrey and Curtis Samuel will likely eat up some of the shorter targets that used to go to","him."
"82","Cameron Meredith","CHI","WR36","9","Despite catching passes from the same quarterbacks and seeing essentially the same number of","targets, Meredith finished with 67 more yards and two more touchdowns than Alshon Jeffery last year. He suffered a broken thumb during","OTA's which could derail his ascension up the depth","chart, as","he's out until training camp. There is plenty of risk considering the Bears signing Victor","Cruz, Kendall","Wright, and Marcus","Wheaton, but we also know that","there's plenty of","upside."
"83","Marcus Mariota","TEN","QB8","8","It's hard not to take notice as to what the Titans have done this","off-season, precisely in their attempts to get Mariota more weapons. Not only did they draft Corey Davis and Taywan","Taylor, they also went out and signed Eric Decker to a one-year contract. If Mariota","disappoints, it","won't be because of the talent around","him."
"84","DeSean Jackson","TB","WR37","11","He'll be drafted much higher than","this, but Jackson is going to find it tough to crack the top-30 with Mike Evans on the other side of the field. This was a better real-life football signing than it was for fantasy purposes.","He'll turn 31-years-old at the end of the","season."
"85","Jameis Winston","TB","QB9","11","Everything that has happened this off-season for the","Bucs, has happened because they want Winston to have all the tools to succeed. It would have been nice to see them build up the offensive line a","bit, but really good wide receivers can help make up for that.","He's finished inside the top 16 quarterbacks each of his first two","seasons, and this is the season he takes the leap into the top","12."
"86","Jeremy Maclin","BAL","WR38","10","In what was probably the best move for his fantasy","value, Maclin was released by the Chiefs only to be picked up by the Ravens just a few days later.","It's rare for the Chiefs to total more than 500 pass","attempts, while the Ravens led the NFL with 678 pass attempts last year. They also lost Steve","Smith, whose role now belongs to Maclin. Over his time with the","Ravens, Smith totaled 8.32 targets per game. If Maclin takes over that role and sees 130","targets,","he's a steal at his current","ADP."
"87","Eric Decker","TEN","WR39","8","It's unclear as to what is going on with Decker right","now, but as of","now, we have to assume","he's on the team.","He's played with some horrid quarterbacks during his","career, yet","he's totaled at least 962 yards or eight touchdowns in every season","he's been a","starter, as well as finishing as a top-36","receiver."
"88","Cam Newton","CAR","QB10","11","He's now finished as the QB17 in two of his last three","seasons, and the Panthers want to take away the thing that creates his fantasy","points, running the ball. Not only did they extend Jonathan","Stewart, but they drafted Christian McCaffrey with a top-eight","pick, and took hybrid running","back/wide receiver Curtis Samuel in the second-round. In the 11 games after his concussion last","year, Newton ran the ball just 61 times for 212 yards and three","touchdowns, a far cry from his 100-plus","carry, 600-yard rushing seasons in the","past."
"89","Martellus Bennett","GB","TE9","8","While the Packers offense","doesn't necessarily target the tight end position that","much, Bennett was someone who they went out and paid good money to acquire. The projections","aren't this high on","him, but","there's massive upside if they do change things up a","bit."
"90","Devante Parker","MIA","WR40","11","This could be a steal if the hype surrounding him this off-season turns out to be true. The coaches questioned him publicly last","year, but have gone out of their way to praise him this","off-season, going all-in on the third-year receiver. There were glimpses last","year, when he had five games with 79 or more","yards, despite seeing more than seven targets just three","times."
"91","Doug Martin","TB","RB32","11","Coming back to a team with Mike","Evans, DeSean","Jackson, O.J.","Howard, and Chris Godwin will be a welcoming sight for","Martin, who only has three games left on his suspension.","We've seen a hit-or-miss Martin over his","career, but he has finished as a top-three running back twice. He could be a steal at this","point."
"92","Zach Ertz","PHI","TE10","10","After banging on the table that Ertz is volume dependent for the last two","years, fantasy players will start to see why this season. After seeing over 300 targets the last three","seasons (was one of just four tight ends who saw at least 100 targets in each of the last two","seasons),","Ertz's best finish sits as the No. 8 tight end in","2016, when it was a really low scoring year for the position as a whole. After seeing them add Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith via free","agency, Ertz is going to need to get much more efficient if he wants to finish as a top-12 tight","end."
"93","Adrian Peterson","NO","RB33","5","Most have dubbed him as dead at this point in his","career,","though I'm not sure","that's the case. The","problem,","however, is that Mark Ingram is likely better than him at this moment. He should see something similar to the role Tim Hightower had the last few","years, making him a touchdown-dependent flex","play."
"94","Derek Carr","OAK","QB11","10","As good as Carr looks at","times,","he's been very volatile as a fantasy option. Carr turned heads with his 35.8 point performance against the Buccaneers last","year, but in his other 14","games, Carr was very mediocre. He totaled just 16.6 points per game in all other","games, which would have ranked 17th among quarterbacks last year. His schedule is among the worst in football and they just brought in Marshawn Lynch to steal some","touchdowns."
"95","John Brown","ARI","WR41","8","There are a lot of people sleeping on the No. 21 wide receiver from just two years","ago, and that was with a younger Larry Fitzgerald and redzone threat Michael Floyd.","All-in-all, he played less than 40 snaps per game in 2016 due to his sickle cell","trait, but","it's now under control. Steal of drafts right","now."
"96","Ben Roethlisberger","PIT","QB12","9","When I initially did my","rankings, Roethlisberger was ranked as my No. 12","quarterback, but something big has happened since that time. Martavis Bryant was reinstated.","He's played 19 career games with","Bryant, averaging 337 yards and 2.11 touchdowns in those games. You have to deal with his road","struggles, but his home games will win you","weeks."
"97","Kenny Britt","CLE","WR42","9","Some are calling Britt a steal where","he's being","drafted,","but I'd say that","he's right where he should be. Did you know that he had never totaled more than 775 yards in any one season before","2016? Or how about the fact that he has recorded more than five touchdowns just once in his","career? Now","he's going to a team","that's got Corey","Coleman, an up-and-coming","phenom, and David","Njoku, the top tight end prospect on some analysts boards. But the real story is that","he's going to be catching passes from either Cody","Kessler, a quarterback who threw just six touchdowns on 195 attempts last","year, or DeShone","Kizer, a rookie whose college coach said that he should still be in","college."
"98","Eric Ebron","DET","TE11","7","Despite missing three games last","year, Ebron finished with the eighth-most yards among tight ends. Had he continued on the same pace for all 16","games, he would have only trailed Travis","Kelce, Greg","Olsen, and Jimmy Graham. With Anquan Boldin","gone, it frees up plenty of targets for both him and Marvin Jones in the red-zone. He could be the tight end drafted outside the top-15 who finishes","top-five."
"99","Randall Cobb","GB","WR43","8","If","you're going to bet on any player to bounce back from a bad","season, bet on a player who has Aaron Rodgers throwing him the football. Cobb has finished as a top-12 wide","receiver (points per","game) twice in his","career, and still showed flashes despite struggling to play through injuries for much of the year.  Jordy Nelson is 32-years-old and Davante Adams still has a lot to","prove."
"100","LeGarrette Blount","PHI","RB34","10","I'm not buying another double-digit touchdown season from","Blount, as","he's almost 31-years-old and was very mediocre outside of his time in New England. You thought Ryan Mathews was frustrating under Doug","Pederson? Good luck with","Blount."
"101","Corey Coleman","CLE","WR44","9","Drafted to be a","game-changer, Coleman will look to get back on track after an injury-filled rookie season where we saw glimpses of the player he could be. Kenny Britt will command","targets,","sure, but nowhere close to the 140 that Terrelle Pryor saw last year. It","shouldn't shock you if Coleman finishes as a top-24 wide receiver in","2017."
"102","Dak Prescott","DAL","QB13","6","Was the No. 6 quarterback last year on a points per game basis if you were to remove Week 17 when he was pulled after one series. There were only four quarterbacks who were","QB1's in 68.8 percent of their games last","year: Tom","Brady, Matt","Ryan, Aaron","Rodgers, and","Prescott (that includes his Week 17","game). My biggest concern is his","schedule."
"103","Philip Rivers","LAC","QB14","9","A brutal start to his schedule will likely prevent Rivers from reaching the heights that most have set for him.","He'll have to play the Broncos","twice,","Chiefs,","Giants,","Raiders,","Patriots, and Jaguars in the first nine games. His numbers have fallen off after Week 8 in the three past","seasons, so keep your expectations for him","realistic."
"104","C.J. Prosise","SEA","RB35","6","We were only able to see 47 touches for the rookie in","2016, but they were extremely","impressive, netting 380 total yards and a touchdown. The concern is that the Seahawks brought in Eddie","Lacy, as they were clearly unhappy with the health of their running backs last year. With the versatility that Prosise","offers, it","shouldn't shock anyone if he gets 10-12 touches out of the gate. If he can stay","healthy, Pete Carroll will find ways to utilize him in the passing","game."
"105","Jordan Matthews","PHI","WR45","10","Going from one side of the spectrum to the","other, Matthews went from the clear-cut No. 1 receiver in his","offense, to what now might be the No. 3 option. Not that he","isn't","talented, but he","didn't live up to the","expectations, leading the Eagles to acquire both Alshon Jeffery and Torrey Smith in free agency. He finished top-24 in each of his first two","seasons, though volume was a big reason for that.","He'll not only be dealing with the competition for","targets, but also dealing with the inconsistencies of a young","quarterback."
"106","Adam Thielen","MIN","WR46","9","Despite the fact","that I'm a huge Stefon Diggs","fan, one cannot escape the fact that Thielen saw 20 fewer","targets, yet finished with 64 more yards and two more touchdowns. Once Diggs moved into the","slot, Thielen started to do most of his","damage, including his","202-yard, two touchdown performance in Week 16 against the Packers.","He's still got a lot to","prove, but 2016 was incredibly promising for the former undrafted free","agent."
"107","Mike Wallace","BAL","WR47","10","The Ravens likely held onto his contract because they","didn't have another receiver to step up and command 100-plus targets this","season, and they","didn't draft one either. Wallace has finished as a top-28 wide receiver in seven of his eight seasons and is in a good position to do the same in","2017."
"108","Hunter Henry","LAC","TE12","9","I get","it, he finished as the No. 11 tight end in his rookie season. He also saw just 53 targets despite Keenan","Allen, Travis","Benjamin, Antonio","Gates, and Melvin Gordon being hurt at times during the year. That was also before Mike Williams was drafted at No. 7 overall. Unless Henry scores a touchdown every 6.6 targets like he did last","year,","it's unlikely he comes close to his current TE8","ADP."
"109","Matthew Stafford","DET","QB15","7","Stafford finished as the No. 7 quarterback in","2016, but his totals were nothing to write home","about, especially over the final 10 games. After throwing three or more touchdowns in four of their first six","games, Stafford","didn't have a single game with more than two touchdowns the rest of the season. He turned into somewhat of a game","manager, which is good for their","team, but not so much for your fantasy team. He scored more than 17 fantasy points just twice after","Week 6."
"110","Jack Doyle","IND","TE13","11","Despite playing alongside Dwayne Allen and with a less-than-100-percent Andrew","Luck, Doyle was able to finish as the No. 13 tight end last","year, yet his ADP is currently in the 13th round as the 16th tight end off the board. If Doyle","isn't in your top-12 tight","ends, you should be expecting big things from Erik","Swoope."
"111","Duke Johnson","CLE","RB36","9","You","don't have to draft Johnson in this spot to get","him, as his ADP is currently 13.11 as the 174th player off the board. Not only will Johnson have borderline flex-value while playing second-fiddle to Isaiah","Crowell, but","he'd be an RB1 if Crowell were to miss time.","Johnson's talent is the reason he was drafted in the seventh-round last","year, not because of his","situation."
"112","Tyrell Williams","LAC","WR48","9","Just one year after finishing as the No. 13 wide","receiver, there are plenty of question marks surrounding Williams. Not only is Keenan Allen returning from","injury, but the Chargers surprised everyone by drafting Mike Williams with the No. 7 pick in the draft. Competition for targets is the key","here, and by the Chargers","actions,","they'll be hard to come by for last","year's breakout receiver. He still offers plenty of upside later in","drafts."
"113","Matt Forte","NYJ","RB37","11","It was one of those","situations, where Forte lost his job while trying to deal with an injury last year. Some have said that Powell was playing because Forte was","hurt, but that","wasn't the case over the final two weeks. Considering what the Jets are paying","Forte,","he's going to have a","role, but you","can't expect too much out of a soon-to-be 32-year-old running","back."
"114","Quincy Enunwa","NYJ","WR49","11","Fun","fact: despite seeing 23 fewer targets than Brandon","Marshall, Enunwa finished with 69 more yards and one more touchdown. After seeing both Marshall and Eric Decker leave via free","agency, Enunwa is left to be the No. 1 option on a Jets team","who'll find themselves in passing situations more often than not in 2017.","Don't be surprised if Enunwa totals at least 125","targets, which would almost lock him into top-35","production."
"115","Corey Davis","TEN","WR50","8","He's an amazing talent and one that should be a force in the league for years to","come, but","it's a rare scenario in which a rookie comes in at wide receiver to dominate right away. Settling him in the WR3 range is the most likely of","scenarios."
"116","James White","NE","RB38","9","The ""should have","been" Super Bowl MVP has been underrated this","off-season, but not by the people that matter most. The Patriots extended him this off-season and paid him more than any other running back on the roster. He was the only player who finished in the top-36 last year without seeing at least 110 touches. If his role","grows, as we expect it","to, White should be in the running to finish as an RB2 in PPR leagues and a solid RB3 in standard","leagues."
"117","Tyrod Taylor","BUF","QB16","6","Finished as the QB7 on a point per game basis in","2016, and was after finishing as the QB8 in 2015. He continues to be one of the most under-appreciated players in all of fantasy. The Bills went out and spent a high-2nd-round pick in order to snag wide receiver Zay","Jones, giving him a legitimate threat opposite Sammy","Watkins, who is now in a contract","year."
"118","Kareem Hunt","KC","RB39","10","There is a lot of talk in the fantasy community about the Chiefs and the future of their running back","position, and rightfully","so, as Andy Reid continually produces top-tier fantasy running backs. Spencer Ware wore down as the season went","on, but had been one of the strengths of their offense prior to the last few weeks in the 2016 season. Hunt is likely going to take over backup duties for Charcandrick","West, but will have upside for much more. It might take a few weeks to reap the full benefits of owning","him,","though."
"119","Derrick Henry","TEN","RB40","8","It","shouldn't shock you if Henry takes over as the lead-dog in the Titans","backfield, as","he's in his","prime, while Murray is on the wrong side of 29. Henry averaged 4.96 yards per carry with four touchdowns over the final five","weeks, while Murray averaged just 3.5 yards per carry and scored one touchdown over his final six","games."
"120","Samaje Perine","WAS","RB41","5","This is based on pure assumption that Perine gets the starting job by Week 4. If he gets named the starter in the","preseason, Perine would be moved into the 50-60 overall pick range. Perine can do everything Rob Kelley can do on first and second-down even","better, and he can actually catch the ball. Stay","tuned."
"121","Eli Manning","NYG","QB17","8","The last time Manning had a season like the one he did in","2016, was 2013 when he threw for","just 3,818","yards, 18","touchdowns, and 27 interceptions. What he did the following two seasons was near pro-bowl","caliber, averaging just","over 4,400 yards and 33 touchdowns. The additions of Brandon Marshall and Evan Engram should only help him get back to that area. If","not, this may be the end for the two-time Super Bowl","champion."
"123","Rishard Matthews","TEN","WR51","8","He's not going to just disappear now that Corey Davis is in","town, but he was due for touchdown regression regardless. There were just two wide receivers with more than 100 targets who caught more touchdowns on a per target","basis, Jordy Nelson and Davante Adams. They both have Aaron Rodgers throwing to","them."
"124","Marvin Jones","DET","WR52","7","Just how good was Marvin","Jones' start to","2016? Good enough that despite totaling just 448 yards and two touchdowns over the final 12","weeks, that he still finished as a top-40 wide receiver. His 482 yards and two touchdowns over the first four games were good enough to be the No. 3","receiver, behind only Julio Jones and Antonio Brown. With Anquan Boldin","gone, we should see","Jones' touchdown total shoot up.","There's room for WR2 numbers in this","offense."
"125","Darren Sproles","PHI","RB43","10","Over the last three seasons while in","Philadelphia, Sproles has finished with","716,","705, and 865 total yards. Pretty","consistent,","right? I'd say the first two are the likeliest of","scenarios, because the increase last year was out of necessity with Ryan Mathews shelved. The addition of LeGarrette Blount will also take away a few scoring","opportunities, but Sproles also produces for those looking for a low-upside flex","option."
"126","Jonathan Stewart","CAR","RB44","11","It's been a roller coaster of an off-season for","Stewart, as he had his contract","extended, but then witnessed his team select two running backs with their first two picks. While Curtis Samuel","isn't a traditional running","back, he will get carries. And to spend a top-eight pick on a running back says a lot how they feel about their current situation.","It's hard to see Stewart finish with more than 120 carries this season and he","doesn't catch","passes, so","we're left with non-starter type","numbers."
"127","Andy Dalton","CIN","QB18","6","Most","don't know that Dalton has finished as a top-12 fantasy quarterback in three of the last five","years, including a No. 4 finish in 2013.","He's got some issues on the offensive","line, but he also has the best receiving options","he's ever","had, and","it's really not all that","close."
"128","Robert Kelley","WAS","RB45","5","Most remember Kelley for his Monday night performance against the Packers in Week 11 where he finished with 137 yards and three","touchdowns, but they","must've missed what ensued after that game. In the final six games of the","season, Kelley averaged just 3.33 yards per carry on 84 carries with two touchdowns. He averaged just 8.05 fantasy points per game in that","stretch, leading the Redskins to go out and snag Samaje Perine in the NFL Draft. You","shouldn't bet on him to retain the starting job for very","long, as he can only contribute on first and second","down, making the offense","predictable."
"129","Coby Fleener","NO","TE14","5","Most","don't realize that Fleener finished as the No. 12 fantasy tight end last","year, despite playing what seemed to be his worst year as a professional. While it was a down year for the tight end position as a","whole, it just goes to show how unpredictable the position is. When you have Drew Brees throwing to","you,","it's hard to say that many other tight ends have the weekly ceiling that Fleener does. With Brandin Cooks off to New","England, someone needs to step up in the passing","game, especially over the middle of the","field."
"130","Jason Witten","DAL","TE15","6","Boring,","sure, but Witten","hasn't finished outside the top-14 at his position since","2003, his rookie year. Looking at the Cowboys","schedule, it looks better for him than it does for Dez","Bryant, who will see a lot of the","league's top-tier cornerbacks. If","you're looking for a","low-upside, though safe option at an extremely volatile","position, Witten is the guy for","you."
"131","Jamaal Charles","DEN","RB46","5","Sadly, this may be the end for J.C. He","hasn't","really 'played' in a","year-and-a-half, and when he","did, he","wasn't the same player. After attempting to return from his second torn","ACL, Charles wound up having to get both of his knees cleaned out towards the end of last season.","He's still not participating in","OTA's, so","it's very likely that Devontae Booker beats him out for the change-of-pace role behind C.J. Anderson. Even if he","sticks,","he'll likely max out at 8-10 touches per","game."
"132","Latavius Murray","MIN","RB47","9","Despite finishing as the No. 13 running back in","2016, Murray","wasn't very","good, hence the reason the Raiders let him walk to sign a 31-year-old retired running back. Going from the Raiders offensive line","that's ranked top-three in the NFL to the Vikings offensive line that ranks among the five worst was already a","problem, but then he had foot","surgery, and the Vikings traded up to draft Dalvin Cook in the second round.","It's likely that Murray has seen his final days of fantasy","relevance."
"133","Denver","Broncos","DST1","5",""
"134","Breshad Perriman","BAL","WR53","10","As discussed earlier in this","article, the Ravens threw the ball more than any other team in 2016 and they lost 151 of their targets to wide receivers this","off-season (Steve Smith and Kamar","Aiken). Perriman may never live up to the expectations some set for","him, but he may be a WR3 on volume alone in","2017."
"135","Terrance West","BAL","RB48","10","At the very","least, you should get four usable performances out of West while Kenneth Dixon is serving his suspension. Fresh to start the","season, West averaged 4.70 yards per carry with three touchdowns in the first six","games, but struggled down the","stretch, averaging just 3.43 yards per carry once Dixon joined the backfield. He also scored just two rushing touchdowns over the final 10 games with","Dixon, making him unplayable. At least","he's a very cheap guy to target with","Dixon, as","you're guaranteed the starting running back for the Ravens with just your 8th and 10th round","picks."
"136","Kevin White","CHI","WR54","9","It's been an incredibly disappointing start to","White's","career, but the Bears are going to give him every opportunity to live up to his draft spot in 2017.","They're concerned about his health and whether or not it has affected his speed in and out of his","breaks, but as long as","he's on the","field,","he'll be targeted by Mike Glennon. If he plays all 16","games,","it's hard to see any scenario where he","doesn't see at least 110 targets. If","that's the","case, he should finish in the","WR3/4","range."
"137","Giovani Bernard","CIN","RB49","6","It's getting more and more likely that Bernard","isn't ready for the start of the 2017","season, which would give rookie Joe Mixon a clear leg-up on the receiving duties for the Bengals.","He's also coming back from a torn","ACL, which could take some time for him to regain his form. A player","who's offered little upside since coming into the","league,","he's not someone","who'll help you win fantasy","titles."
"138","Sterling Shepard","NYG","WR55","8","There were 41 players who saw at least 100 targets in","2016, and just four scored more touchdowns on a per-target","basis: Davante","Adams, Jordy","Nelson, Rishard","Matthews, and Antonio Brown. Not too bad for a","rookie,","right? The additions of Brandon Marshall and Evan Engram cloud his","outlook, but he just might surprise people who take a chance on him later in","drafts."
"139","Robert Woods","LAR","WR56","8","He was extremely inefficient in his time with the","Bills, but he did flash in a few games last","season, leading the Rams to pony up some dough this offseason.","It'll be interesting to see how they use him after drafting slot receiver Cooper Kupp at the start of the third","round."
"140","Ted Ginn","NO","WR57","5","It's quite possible that Ginn moves up the rankings if we see him in two wide receiver sets for the Saints. While Cam","Newton's arm fit his","skill-set,","he's now got one of the best deep ball quarterbacks in the league throwing to him. Ginn is a fantastic bench player to","draft, and once he has a big","week, sell","high, as he","won't carry much week-to-week","consistency."
"141","Josh Doctson","WAS","WR58","5","Don't forget that Doctson was the No. 1 pick for the Redskins last year and that head coach Jay Gruden compared him to A.J. Green. All reports coming back from","OTA's were positive and beat reporters are saying that","he'll attempt to take over the Pierre Garcon role. This would be great","news, as Garcon has seen 111 and 114 targets over the last two","years."
"142","Carson Palmer","ARI","QB19","8","It's pretty obvious that","Palmer's 2015 season was an outlier in","what's been a mediocre career. Despite throwing 60 more passes in","2016, he finished with 438 fewer yards and nine fewer touchdowns. It","didn't help that John Brown was injured for a majority of the season and that Michael Floyd turned bad. They added Chad Williams in the NFL","Draft, but","he's an extremely raw receiver.
