"Le'Veon Bell","Despite having a less-successful year than his 2016 campaign - Bell still finished No. 2 among fantasy running backs. His contract dispute is not going away any time soon - which moves him down under Todd Gurley due to safety. We fully expect Bell to suit-up when the lights come on in Week 1 - but there's always a chance he doesn't. Another added risk is that he'll have a new offensive coordinator in 2018 - though Randy Fichtner doesn't appear to be shy running a fast-paced offense."
"Todd Gurley","After a historical campaign where he scored 21.3 standard points per game (most since Chris Johnson's magical 2009 season) - Gurley sits atop the draft rankings. The Rams did go out and acquire Brandin Cooks - but they also re-built their entire defense - which should only lead to more rushing attempts for Gurley. He's as safe as they come atop the draft."
"David Johnson","Some have Johnson as high as No. 1 in our consensus rankings - but I'd urge against drafting him with a top-three pick. Did you know that 73.3 percent (22-of-30) of top-six running backs over the last six years have come from top-12 scoring offenses? I'd argue that the Cardinals would likely be a bottom-10 scoring offense in 2018 - and there's been just three running backs who have overcome that to become a top-six running back over the last six years. Johnson scored 20 touchdowns in his magical 2016 season - something that's not repeatable. It's also worth noting that since Week 6 of 2016 - he's averaged just 3.63 yards per carry on 191 carries. He's still worth a mid-first-round pick - but I'd take someone in a better offense over him."
"Antonio Brown","My overall ranking might be too low on the No. 1 wide receiver who has now finished inside the top-three at his position in each of the last four years - but passing on a volume running back is hard to do. Brown is as consistent as they come - as he's now posted at least WR2 numbers in 57 of his last 77 games - which amounts to 74 percent of the time. The only wide receivers who were able to accomplish that in just one year (2017) were Deandre Hopkins and Michael Thomas. He's the No. 1 wide receiver and it's not even debatable at this point. He's like a fine wine that gets better with age."
"Ezekiel Elliott","The good news is that the Cowboys offensive line has been replenished in both free agency and the draft. The bad news is that there's little talent surrounding Elliott - which could prove to make life difficult on him. While Dez Bryant and Jason Witten weren't in their primes - they demanded attention from opposing defensive coordinators. Unfortunately - Terrance Williams and Allen Hurns don't. Elliott will get all the work he can handle - which is important but just how efficient can he be?"
"DeAndre Hopkins","There are a lot of fantasy football owners going gaga over Hopkins in 2018 - but I'd warn you to proceed with caution. Not only did the Texans throw a lot more than they wanted to in 2017 because of all the injuries on the defensive side of the ball - but the 9.3 percent touchdown rate by Deshaun Watson is completely inflated. While Hopkins remains one of the safest wide receivers due to his volume - you don't want to pay for last year's performance. Don't forget that he finished as the WR36 in 2016 while seeing 151 targets. I get it - Watson is better than what he's had - but temper those expectations."
"Alvin Kamara","Did you know that Kamara scored more fantasy points on just his receiving totals than Amari Cooper - Sammy Watkins - and Jordy Nelson did in 2017? His 826 yards and five touchdowns would've ranked 24th among wide receivers. We're talking about a running back. Even if we dial back some of his efficiency - the suspension of Mark Ingram can give him some touches to help compensate. It's only natural that a player going into year two would receive more touches - anyway."
"Odell Beckham Jr.","It's now a 47-game sample size - so we have plenty of data to analyze him against. Beckham Jr. has posted WR1 numbers in 48.9 percent of those games - which is simply ridiculous. Just how ridiculous? Well - the closest wide receiver to his totals over the last 15 years is Julio Jones - who has hit the WR1 mark in 40.4 percent of his games. The addition of Saquon Barkley is likely to take away some of his massive potential - but he's still a generational talent that is going to be heavily involved."
"Julio Jones","If you're fortunate to land Jones late in the first - consider yourself one lucky person. While some have said he's inconsistent - the numbers tell a different story. He's finished with WR1 numbers in 40.4 percent of his career games - which ranks second to only Odell Beckham Jr. since 2001. If you think he's too boom or bust," the only players who have posted a higher WR3 percentage than his (73.4 percent) are Beckham Jr. - Antonio Brown - A.J. Green - and Michael Thomas. He's a stud who is due for some positive touchdown regression. He might be the only one who can compete with Brown for the top wide receiver spot."
"Michael Thomas","What Thomas lacked in upside in 2017 - he made up for with consistency - as he was finished with WR2 or better numbers 75 percent of the time - which ranked second to only Deandre Hopkins. Should some of Alvin Kamara's regression go Thomas' way - you'll be getting a steal in the second-round - as he'll finish as a top-five wide receiver. Most don't realize that he finished top-eight last year despite scoring just five times. As long as Drew Brees is his quarterback - Thomas is worth a top-20 pick in any format."
"Saquon Barkley","When a team selects a running back with the No. 2 overall pick in today's game - they're going to use him - a lot. Last year in Pat Shurmur's offense - then-rookie Dalvin Cook totaled 71 touches in the team's first three games before getting hurt in Week 4. His pace was 379 total touches - which would have ranked No. 2 behind only Todd Gurley. Unlike Ezekiel Elliott - Barkley won't even be the opponent's biggest fear as long as Odell Beckham Jr. is on the field."
"Keenan Allen","After starting out the season extremely slow (595 yards - one touchdown through the first nine games) - Allen exploded over the final seven games of the season - posting 798 yards and five touchdowns. His emergence came as the team started to move away from Antonio Gates - who is no longer with the team in 2018. The concern with him is that Mike Williams (who they drafted in the top-10 last year) will see much more playing time and is a real red zone threat - though the loss of Hunter Henry definitely clears up some targets. Allen has been a fantasy asset when he's on the field - so there's little reason to doubt him now."
"Kareem Hunt","Last offseason - I was telling fantasy players to draft both Spencer Ware and Kareem Hunt (when they were both going outside the top seven rounds) because you were guaranteed RB1 production out of one of them. When Ware went down - I pounded the table for Hunt as a late second-round pick under Andy Reid. He ran with the job - so he's the clear-cut starter for them in 2018 - and it's a team who packs some serious offensive firepower - provided Pat Mahomes is the real deal. There's tons of mouths to feed between Hunt - Sammy Watkins - Tyreek Hill - and Travis Kelce - but I'll remind you that you want Reid's starting running back no matter who it is. Hunt just happened to show you that he's an above average running back last year - breaking an NFL-high 19 runs of more than 15 yards. They accounted for 521 yards - or 39.3 percent of his season total."
"Melvin Gordon","After a disappointing rookie campaign - Gordon has been among the most consistent running backs in fantasy football the last two years - posting RB2 or better numbers in 24-of-29 games. His durability is a concern - though - as he missed five games over his first two years - and parts of others in 2017. The Chargers figure to be a high-scoring team once again in 2018 - which bodes well for his chances of finishing as a top-12 running back for the third straight season."
"A.J. Green","Over Green's career - he's posted WR3 or better numbers in 76.2 percent of his games. The only wide receivers who have better numbers over their careers are Michael Thomas and Odell Beckham Jr. Despite the Bengals offense being extremely underwhelming in 2017 - Green still somehow managed to finish top-10 for the fourth time in the last six years. He may never make it to the top-three - but he's consistent enough to warrant a second-round pick."
"Davante Adams","After many wrote him off after his first two seasons - Adams has top-three wide receiver in his range of possibilities in 2018. I mean - the guy finished as a top-12 wide receiver with Brett Hundley starting the majority of the season. He'll now be the No. 1 wide receiver for Aaron Rodgers - which makes him as safe as they come at the position. He's scored 17 touchdowns in his last 22 games with Rodgers under center."
"Dalvin Cook","After totaling 71 touches over the first three games - Cook didn't get to show us much of a sample size - though what we did see looked promising. One downfall is that Pat Shurmur is no longer calling plays for the Vikings - though some are excited to see what Joe DiFilippo can do in that role. Still - the defense is as good as ever - which is only good news for Cook's projected attempts. After analyzing the strength of schedule in our own way - Cook had the best schedule among all running backs."
"Leonard Fournette","If we could guarantee that Fournette would stay on the field for all 16 games - he'd be worthy of a top-five pick - but his foot troubles are a concern. Not only did Blake Bortles start to play competently toward the end of the season - but the Jaguars added Andrew Norwell in free agency - who is one of the best offensive guards in football. Fournette should see some lighter fronts en route to another top-10 finish."
"Doug Baldwin","While everyone seems to be foaming at the mouth to draft Rashaad Penny - it's Baldwin who is the most valuable asset on the Seahawks roster. It's rare to find a wide receiver who is as underappreciated as Baldwin - who has now finished as a top-13 wide receiver in each of the last three seasons. Not only has he averaged 1062.7 yards in that span - but he's scored 29 touchdowns - and that was with Jimmy Graham on the roster. I shouldn't have to remind you that Graham is gone - and the Seahawks didn't add a wide receiver of significance to replace Paul Richardson. Baldwin is a low-end WR1 with upside."
"Christian McCaffrey","The signing of C.J. Anderson most definitely hurt McCaffrey's upside in the Panthers offense - but they weren't going to give him 200 carries regardless of that. He's not designed to handle that type of work and Ron Rivera has acknowledged that. It also doesn't help that Greg Olsen is back to soak up a lot of targets (averaged 125 targets/year prior to getting hurt in 2017) - as is newly-drafted D.J. Moore. While they won't erase what McCaffrey has done for this offense - it's unlikely he sees 113 targets again. Think of him as an Alvin Kamara-lite version whose ceiling may be around the RB10 range in standard formats."
"Jerick McKinnon","No matter how you feel about McKinnon's talent - the 49ers have told you everything you need to know when they paid him $30 million over four years. You should know that the 49ers could get out of the contract after one year with just a $1.5 million cap hit in 2019 - but that's not why you sign someone like him. They also passed on a lot of running backs in the draft - showing confidence in the guys on the roster. He's never been great on first- and second-down - but unless you believe Matt Breida or Joe Williams is going to walk into 15 carries per game - you need to rank McKinnon aggressively. He figures to be the Devonta Freeman of Kyle Shanahan's offense - which we know is extremely valuable."
"Mike Evans","Anyone who drafted Evans last year has a bad taste in their mouth - though we've always said that touchdowns are the hardest thing to predict - even when you're 6-foot-5 and 231 pounds. Evans now has two 12 touchdown seasons under his belt - but the other two netted a combined eight touchdowns. Still - he's now produced 1000 yards in each of his four seasons - which is something you need to value. If Jameis Winston takes a step forward in his career - Evans could be right back in the first-round conversation next year."
"Rob Gronkowski","It's not a clear-cut situation anymore with Gronkowski atop the tight end board - though I've kept him there myself. While the Patriots got rid of Brandin Cooks - the Chiefs and Travis Kelce added Sammy Watkins to further cloudy the target situation. Gronkowski is one of the few tight ends you can put down in marker that he'll see 100-plus targets if healthy - and he just happens to play with one of the greatest quarterbacks of all-time. He gives you an advantage at the most unpredictable position in fantasy."
"Devonta Freeman","Freeman has lost some of his luster with Tevin Coleman becoming more and more involved - but he's still a fantasy producer. The reason to be pessimistic about him - though - is that he received 12 or fewer carries in eight of his final 10 games in 2017. That's going to make it tough to produce as the top-10 running back that he is - though his work in the receiving game helps. He doesn't have top-three upside as long as Coleman is healthy - but he'll likely produce as an RB2 or better the majority of time."
"Adam Thielen","Most don't realize how much of an effect that Pat Shurmur had on Thielen's career - as he catapulted him into a household fantasy name. He was 26 years old when he broke out - something that doesn't happen all that often. The move to John DiFilippo will change some things - as will the move to Kirk Cousins - who has taken more chances down the field than game-manager Case Keenum did. That would play more into Stefon Diggs' skill-set rather than Thielen's. I do expect him to be a reliable fantasy producer - but he's not going to finish with 143 targets again."
"Larry Fitzgerald","I'm done trying to predict when father time will catch up with Fitzgerald - as it seemed like he was on his way out in 2014 - only he has since posted WR11 - WR17 - and WR9 seasons (in standard formats). The quarterback position arguably upgraded with Sam Bradford and Josh Rosen this offseason - though the offense is going to look different under head coach Steve Wilks. There's still not another player on this team who sniffs Fitzgerald's level of talent at wide receiver - so I'd fully expect another top-24 season out of him."
"Travis Kelce","While some will try to make the argument for Kelce over Rob Gronkowski - I won't be one of them - simply because the Chiefs now have an abundance of offensive weapons that are going to need touches. They signed Sammy Watkins for nearly $50 million - which tells you how much they wanted him - and Tyreek Hill has remained as efficient as ever - so it's hard to argue that you should take targets away from him. Ultimately - I still love Kelce as an asset - but he's lost some of the upside he presented in 2017 - which still had him finish eight points behind Gronkowski... and he played one more game than Gronkowski did - too."
"T.Y. Hilton","It's very possible that Hilton moves down depending on how Andrew Luck looks this preseason (really hoping to see him play in those weeks) - but I'm remaining optimistic for the time-being. During the time he played with Luck - Hilton finished in-between the WR5 and WR24 range every season. He's not someone you draft for consistency - however - as he's posted WR2 or better numbers in just 42.6 percent of his career games."
"Stefon Diggs","The addition of Kirk Cousins has everyone excited - though the one who should be most excited is Diggs - who might see more targets float his way. After playing with Case Keenum - who was more of a game manager - Diggs should be more of a field stretcher for Cousins - as he can create separation at every level of the field. Meanwhile - Adam Thielen had a boost in production under Pat Shurmur - who is now gone. As of now - Thielen is going earlier than Diggs in drafts - but it really should be the other way around. Take the discount on Diggs and pass on Thielen."
"Tyreek Hill","It's clear that Tyreek Hill is among the most efficient wide receivers in the game - as his 11.3 yards per target in 2017 ranked first in the league among those with 70 or more targets. Not just that - but the closest player to him was Marvin Jones at 10.3 YPT (a whopping 9 percent difference). That number came up quite a bit from his 2016 total that was at 7.1 yards per target - so you might want to dial back those large expectations. The addition of Sammy Watkins isn't going to help him gain a higher target share - either - as they paid Watkins a generous $50 million. As high as you might be on Pat Mahomes - it's going to be incredibly hard for him to top Alex Smith's MVP-caliber 2017 season. There's regression coming for Hill - but his price does not reflect that."
"Demaryius Thomas","It's become the cool thing to avoid Thomas in drafts - and there's good reason for that. He's been trending in the wrong direction since Peyton Manning retired - finishing as the WR13 - WR19 - and then the WR23 in 2017. The impressive part is his consistency - despite the inconsistency from the quarterback position. The addition of Case Keenum will help more than it'll hurt - so find it in your heart to welcome Thomas into your WR2 slot - as he offers more safety than most taken in this range."
"Joe Mixon","Most have somehow forgotten how highly-touted Mixon was coming out of Oklahoma. He's a true three-down workhorse running back that can handle 20-plus touches per game if they want him to - and that's exactly how they treated him once Jeremy Hill went down last year - as he averaged 17.6 touches per game from Week 8-12 before he hurt his ankle in Week 13. Those 17.6 touches per game would've ranked as the 13th most among running backs last year. If the Bengals can become a competent offense once again after rebuilding the offensive line - Mixon has top-five upside."
"Golden Tate","I get it - Tate isn't a sexy pick that'll win you your fantasy league - but he's now finished as a top-34 receiver in each of the last six seasons - including a WR19 finish last year while Marvin Jones had a miraculous season. With the exit of Eric Ebron - some targets may open up over the middle of the field - while Jones now has to fight for perimeter targets with Kenny Golladay. Tate's role in the offense is safe - as he's now seen at least 120 targets in each of the last four seasons."
"Zach Ertz","If Ertz can stay on the field for all 16 games - he's could be right there in the tier with Gronk and Kelce - but he's dealt with some nagging injuries the last two seasons that have caused him to miss four games. Still - his consistency is something - as he's not finished with 74-78 catches and 816-853 yards in each of the last three seasons - though he doubled his touchdown output in 2017. It wasn't a bad thing to see Trey Burton leave - but the Eagles immediately replaced him with Dallas Goedert - who is a massive red zone threat. Because of that - I'll keep Ertz in the tier below the alpha dogs - but he's not far behind."
"Jordan Howard","In standard formats - feel free to draft Howard in the second-round - as he's going to be the workhorse on first- and second-down for new head coach Matt Nagy - who comes from Andy Reid's tutelage. Howard has been one of the most reliable runners in football the last two years - averaging 4.61 yards per carry while the defense knew exactly what they were doing - with no other real threat on the field for a majority of those games. His lack of passing-down work limits his upside - but he's extremely safe in standard because there isn't another running back on the roster who can net 200-plus carries."
"Amari Cooper","After posting back-to-back 1000-yard seasons to open his career - Cooper hit some speed bumps in 2017 - as he finished with just 680 yards in 14 games. It was even worse than that - though - as he accumulated 30.9 percent of his yardage in just one game. We do know that his ankle caused him to miss nearly two full games - but it's rare to see a wide receiver struggle the way he did when coming off two impressive seasons. It may not have helped that Derek Carr was dealing with a back injury as well - so we'll chalk that season up to an outlier in what's been a great start to a career. The Raiders cut Michael Crabtree - which helps - but then brought in both Jordy Nelson and Martavis Bryant to replenish the weaponry. Still - Cooper is the only one who has rapport with his quarterback - so I'd expect him to bounce back to WR2 status in 2018."
"Aaron Rodgers","The best in the game - period. By ranking him in the 30-40 range overall - I know that he's unlikely to fall to me in drafts - but that's because of how replaceable the position really is. The dip from Rodgers to someone like Matthew Stafford is typically four points per game - which is a much larger gap from someone like Melvin Gordon down to someone like Giovani Bernard. If Rodgers falls to the end of the third-round - that's when I'd start to consider him."
"Allen Robinson","It typically takes some time for a wide receiver to learn a new offense - which puts him behind where the rest of the wide receiver group is - but Robinson doesn't have to worry about that - as they are all learning a new offense. In fact - the starting trio of wide receivers and tight end will all be new faces for Mitch Trubisky. You don't bring in someone like Robinson in free agency if you aren't going to feature him. I'm expecting a minimum of 120 targets - which essentially locks him in as a top-25 wide receiver - as there were no wide receivers with more than 109 targets who finished outside the top-25 in standard formats."
"Alshon Jeffery","Did you realize that Jeffery had just a 47.5 percent catch rate in 2017? That ranked 168th of the 211 wide receivers who saw at least one target in 2018. To know that he finished as the WR15 despite that is pretty amazing. The chemistry between him and Carson Wentz should grow as time goes on - though his touchdown rate will likely go down with Wentz's. Still - Jeffery is the clear-cut No. 1 receiver in an offense with a creative play-caller and franchise quarterback. His injury-riddled past is factored in - as he'd be higher on my list if he hadn't missed 11 games in the past three years with a lot of soft tissue injuries."
"Kenyan Drake","The stretch that Drake had at the end of 2017 was nothing short of impressive. He was playing on a bad team - but finished as the RB8 during Weeks 13-17. We mustn't forget that Damien Williams was also hurt during most of that time - so it allowed him to receive more touches than usual. Williams is gone - but the Dolphins brought in Frank Gore - who didn't come to collect dust - and drafted Kalen Ballage - a receiving specialist. There's reasons to like Drake - but there are equally as many reasons not to."
"Jarvis Landry","Going from 140-plus targets to one where he will have a tough time seeing 110 targets is a very big deal for someone like Landry. While I believe he's a better football player than what the Dolphins used him as - he's going to play a similar role on the Browns - as Josh Gordon and Corey Coleman are more of the field-stretchers. Knowing that Landry has averaged 7.08 yards per target over his career - his 110 targets would amount to just under 800 yards - and we know he isn't scoring more than six touchdowns. He's just a WR4 in standard leagues."
"LeSean McCoy","I'm not completely sold on drafting McCoy as a top-12 running back - but it's hard to pass on the volume he'll receive this year. Playing on a team with what's likely to have a rookie under center - behind a now-poor offensive line (lost three starters this offseason) - in what's almost guaranteed to be a low-scoring offense? Did I mention that he's going to be 30 years old when the season starts? You can't pass up this type of volume in the second-round - but I wouldn't blame you if you took a wide receiver over him where he's being drafted. As an update - you might be wise pushing McCoy out into the eighth-round - as there could be a looming suspension for some off-the-field acquisitions. You simply cannot risk taking him in the first few rounds with those question marks."
"Alex Collins","A lot of people talk about how good Kenyan Drake was to close out the season - but did you know that Collins was the RB8 in standard formats from Week 8 through Week 17? He was better for a longer stretch - and the offense improved significantly around him this offseason. The only concern you'd have is Kenneth Dixon - who was supposed to be the team's workhorse - but it's possible that they're going to simply move on from him. That built-in risk lowers him on my board just a tad - but I don't think the Ravens would've re-signed him if that were the case."
"Russell Wilson","Once you get down to around the No. 45 overall pick - the sure things are gone - so why not take one of the elite players at his position? Wilson has now finished as a top-three quarterback in three of the last four seasons and has never fallen out of the top-12 quarterbacks in any of his six seasons. His defense is as bad as its ever been - which should force him to partake in some shootouts that never seemed to happen before. Despite the elite defense that was being played - Wilson has posted QB1 numbers in 47.9 percent of his games - including a career-high 68.8 percent of games in 2017. He offers safety and upside - which is rare at the position."
"JuJu Smith-Schuster","Fun fact: Smith-Schuster ranked 55th among wide receivers in targets per game. His 5.6 targets per game ranked behind guys like Kendall Wright and Danny Amendola. His 11.6 yards per target was the best among wide receivers with at least 25 targets - and in fact - it was the best in the last five years. He's going to regress there and the offense didn't change drastically from last year to this year - so seeing his targets make a huge jump is unlikely. We've seen the upside he presents - but that was his absolute ceiling given the opportunities he's capped at. You can't draft a wide receiver who ranked 55th in targets per game in the top-five rounds of your fantasy draft - you just can't."
"Josh Gordon","It didn't seem like Gordon missed a beat upon his return last year - though the quarterback play was less than ideal. 39 percent of his targets were over 20 yards - though just 5-of-16 were catchable. It goes to show that the Browns want to use him down the field - though there's bound to be some changes with Todd Haley taking over as coordinator. The reason I'm down on Gordon - though - is that they brought in Tyrod Taylor - Carlos Hyde - Nick Chubb - and Jarvis Landry this offseason. That screams - we want to run a ball-control style offense." There's only so many targets to go around - so by drafting Gordon as a top-24 receiver - you're essentially saying that Landry is likely to cap out around 100 targets."
"Derrius Guice","As you can see by the rest of my rankings - I'm not shy when it comes to betting on a rookie running back. After watching him fall in the draft for character concerns," the Redskins pounced on a running back they had a first-round grade on. While Guice isn't going to steal the third-down work from Chris Thompson - he's going to be the man they turn to on early downs. That role was occupied by a combination of Samaje Perine and Rob Kelley last year - who combined for 237 carries. If you're worried about Perine or Kelley - don't be. You don't spend a second-round pick on a running back if you have someone that you kind of like."
"Tom Brady","It's really only a matter of time before Brady starts the inevitable downturn to his Hall of Fame career - and we may have already started to witness the beginning of the end. After throwing 26 touchdowns and just three interceptions in the first 11 games - Brady threw just six touchdowns with five interceptions over the final five games - and failed to top 15 fantasy points in any of them. He still gets the benefit of the doubt - but I wouldn't go out of my way to draft him."
"Brandin Cooks","While many continue to prop Cooks up as a low-end WR1 - I urge you to stay away from that territory when it comes to him. The Sean McVay offense doesn't cater to one wide receiver - and it's unlikely they take targets away from Robert Woods and Cooper Kupp - who were both extremely efficient last season. We saw Sammy Watkins finish with 70 targets in this exact role last year - and that was despite them giving up a second-round pick to acquire him. While I'd expect Cooks to see more than that with a full offseason to work with the offense - it'd be a stretch to see him finish with anything more than 100 targets. There were just three wide receivers who finished top-24 last year with less than 100 targets - so while it's doable - it's not a given."
"Michael Crabtree","After seeing 291 targets over a two year period with the Raiders - Crabtree saw that number drop to just 101 targets in 2017. Fortunately for him - he was released and wound up as the No. 1 receiver on another team that should get him somewhere in the range of 110-120 targets. Some will say more than that - but Joe Flacco doesn't heavily target any one receiver. During his 10 years in the league - he's yet to target one more than 137 times - and that includes two seasons with 610-plus attempts. He's a safe WR3 who may give you WR2 production."
"Marvin Jones","After seeing 107 targets in 2017 - Jones' incredible touchdown rate propped him all the way up to the WR5 in standard leagues. He caught a touchdown once every 11.9 targets - which is almost double the average rate for wide receivers - which stands at one every 22.8 targets. After scoring just four touchdowns the prior season in the same offense - you have to wonder just how sustainable his touchdown total is. On top of that - the Lions continue to hype up Kenny Golladay - who is another big-bodied wide receiver to take away some of those looks. Jones is a solid fantasy asset - but don't pay for last year's numbers. He averaged just 5.3 targets per game with Golladay in the lineup - but 9.8 targets per game when he was held out."
"Jay Ajayi","I know that by ranking Ajayi outside the top-24 running backs - he won't wind up on any of my teams - and that's something I'm okay with. Doug Pederson has shown us that he wants to use a committee approach in his offense - He topped 34 snaps just once during his time with the Eagles - with none of the final four games netting any more than 30 snaps. When you're playing that many snaps - your upside goes out the window and you'll be extremely touchdown dependent. With Darren Sproles returning and Corey Clement showing off late in the season - there's no reason to expect it to change. He's going to be frustrating to own."
"Lamar Miller","There were rumors that the Texans may cut Miller this offseason - but nothing ever came to fruition - as it's possible that D'Onta Foreman starts the season on the PUP list after his Achilles injury last year. If that's the case - Miller should move up even further on my list - as he's one of the few running backs who've consistently seen 250-plus touches over the last four years. If Deshaun Watson can be even half the quarterback he was last year - Miller is going to find himself going against a lot of light defensive fronts - which could be the reason he averaged 14.9 PPR points per game with Watson - compared to just 9.9 PPR points per game with Tom Savage."
"Dion Lewis","You should be expecting Lewis to walk right into the old DeMarco Murray role of the offense - as you don't go out and sign a running back in free agency for $20 million for no reason. It's possible that new offensive coordinator Matt LaFleur simply didn't want Derrick Henry to be the guy of the offense - as he's not a great pass-catcher. If LaFleur installs an offense similar to the one Sean McVay used in L.A. - then Lewis could turn out to be a steal at his current cost."
"Deshaun Watson","Just how unrepeatable was Watson's 2017 season? Well - since 2000 - just four other quarterbacks have thrown a touchdown on more than 7.9 percent of their passes. We're talking about the entire careers of Peyton Manning - Tom Brady - Aaron Rodgers - Drew Brees - Ben Roethlisberger - and Philip Rivers. Watson's rate was 9.3 percent in 2017. Looking at all quarterbacks in 2017 - only he and Carson Wentz threw a touchdown on more than 6.7 percent of their attempts - which should give you all you need to know. In fact - you should expect his touchdown percentage to be cut in half (and it'd still be good). He's still among the top quartebacks because of his rushing ability - but don't pay for last year's production - which was still just six games worth."
"Rashaad Penny","The Seahawks have been implying that they intend to run the ball over and over again. The offensive line is lousy as usual - but the offense should put up enough points that if Seattle truly has a workhorse back - he could end up in the RB1 discussion come end of the year. There is plenty of reason to think Penny will have that role from the get-go so be prepared for him to slide up draft boards."
"Cam Newton","After the failed experiment of trying to dial back Newton's rushing attempts in 2016 - it was good to see them unleash him again in 2017. If you take away Newton's ability to run - he wouldn't be a quarterback in this league very long. Fortunately - it seems the Panthers figured that out - making Newton an elite fantasy option once again - rushing for a career-high 754 yards. The upgraded weaponry around him doesn't hurt - either."
"Greg Olsen","While I do believe that Olsen is on the down-slope of his career - he didn't actually fall off a cliff. Prior to getting hurt in 2017 - he'd seen at least 104 targets in each season dating back to 2012. This is where I remind you that there were just six tight ends who topped 95 targets in 2017. You want to chase targets at the most volatile position in fantasy - so even though he may not have top-three upside anymore - he's still a top-eight tight end."
"Corey Davis","Davis is someone I compared to Brandon Marshall during last year's draft process - and after watching him throughout the 2017 season - my expectations haven't changed. He didn't develop any chemistry with Marcus Mariota until playoff time - where he caught nine passes for 98 yards and two touchdowns in their two games. He's still yet to prove it," so you don't want to go all-in - but the potential is there for a top-15 season."
"Mark Ingram","He's suspended for the first four games of the season - sure - but getting him for 12 games will be more valuable than someone like Derrick Henry - who will be touchdown-reliant in all 16 games. It's clear that the Saints don't want to shift more of the early-down work to Alvin Kamara - as Sean Payton said they don't want to change his workload much - even during the first four weeks while Ingram is out. Ingram is also due for some positive regression in the touchdown department - as he caught 58 passes last year without a single touchdown. The league average among running backs is one every 25.6 receptions."
"Derrick Henry","After sharing a backfield with DeMarco Murray the last two years - Henry seemed to have the backfield all to himself once they released Murray this offseason. Instead - they upgraded Murray when they snagged Dion Lewis - who is one of the best pass-blockers in the game and one they paid $20 million to over four years. It's clear that they want Henry to remain in the role he was last year - which netted him 11.7 touches per game (ranked just 42nd among RBs). While I suspect he'll get a small bump - he's not likely to get into the 15-16-touch range - which is what's often required to finish as a top-15 running back. He's going to be touchdown-dependent - something that isn't ideal for someone who costs a third-round pick."
"Evan Engram","Everything that could have went Engram's way last year in terms of targets - did. Both Odell Beckham Jr. and Brandon Marshall were place on I.R. early in the season - while Sterling Shepard was in and out of the lineup with injuries. Not only are Beckham Jr. and Shepard back to full health - but the Giants just spent the No. 2 pick on Saquon Barkley - who is essentially another receiver. Engram is still likely to be a TE1 - but I'm not touching him where he's being drafted."
"Pierre Garcon","After seemingly walking into 140 targets with the 49ers when he signed in free agency - Garcon all of a sudden has plenty of competition for targets. From Marquise Goodwin - to George Kittle - to Jerick McKinnon - and now recently-drafted Dante Pettis. He totaled 67 targets over the first eight games last year which would have put him on pace for 134 - though you shouldn't be expecting more than 110 this season - and possibly less."
"Drew Brees","Since 2008 - Brees' touchdown rate had been 5.0 percent or higher - which was the reason he threw for at least 32 touchdowns in each of those seasons. In 2017 - however - that number dipped to 4.3 percent. Was it Brees slipping? Well - when you look at his record-setting completion percentage (72.0 percent) - highest yards per attempt since 2011 (8.1) - and lowest interception rate in his entire career (1.5 percent) - my answer would be an emphatic no." The touchdowns will come back - as will the pass attempts - and Brees will likely be one of the steals in fantasy drafts."
"Ronald Jones II","Not only have I been bullish on rookie running backs - but I'm bullish on the Bucs offense as a whole. When you have the firepower of Mike Evans - Desean Jackson - Chris Godwin - O.J. Howard - and Cameron Brate in front of you - it's not likely that a defense will ever make it their priority to stop the running back. Those who are concerned about Peyton Barber shouldn't be - as the Bucs would've just snagged one of the free agent running backs available to pair with him. Instead - they used a high second-round pick on the running back who has a similar style to Jamaal Charles. Playing in what could be a top-five scoring offense is never a bad thing."
"Carson Wentz","To give you an idea as to how unrepeatable Wentz's 2017 season was from a touchdown standpoint - let's compare him to Aaron Rodgers. Wentz's touchdown rate was 7.5 percent last year - a number that Rodgers has hit just once in his career. Remember - we are talking about the guy who I'd consider the best of all-time. If we dialed back his touchdown rate to 6.0 percent - which is still elite - he would've thrown seven less touchdowns - which would drop him from the QB5 to QB12. Coming off an ACL tear may limit his mobility at the start of the season - which further impacts his fantasy performance. I'd avoid him as a top-five quarterback off the board."
"Royce Freeman","Another rookie running back? Yep. While there are some who are worried about Devontae Booker - you shouldn't be one of them. He legitimately played behind the running back they just cut (C.J. Anderson) - so what makes you think he'd start in front of a guy they just spent a high third-round pick on? Freeman may not be elite at anything - but he's really good at everything. He's a no-nonsense runner who knows how to follow his blocks - similar to Jordan Howard. In an offense that likely takes a step forward - Freeman should finish as a top-24 running back in his first season."
"Sammy Watkins","It wouldn't shock me to see Watkins finish as the best Chiefs wide receiver - as I believe he's the most talented one. The issue is that he's learning his third offense in three years - which can cripple a wide receiver in year-one. Because of that - Tyreek Hill is the preferred option in 2018. Still - the Chiefs didn't pay Watkins $50 million to see 60-80 targets - so I'd expect him to be a WR3 more often than not. With Pat Mahomes under center and a bad defense - the recipe is there for increased pass attempts."
"Delanie Walker","There's not enough love for the tight end who has now finished top-12 in each of the last five years - including two top-five finishes. While many are expecting Corey Davis to have his breakout season - Walker is the safer choice to rely on for production - even if he doesn't offer extreme upside. Any time you can get 800-plus yards out of a tight end - he's worth consideration as a top-five player at the position. He's kind of like the Demaryius Thomas of tight ends - as he might be boring - but you aren't going to lose your fantasy league because of him."
"Sony Michel","One of the interesting stats I've come across through my offseason research was that rookie running backs who were drafted in the first-round over the last six years finish as a RB1 80 percent of the time. While it's a very small sample size - it just goes to show that when a team invests a first-round pick on a running back - you shouldn't be afraid to roster him. On top of that - he plays for a team that's finished top-three in scoring in every season since 2010. Seriously - that's ridiculous. The only thing that would get in Michel's way is fumbles - so please - protect the ball."
"Emmanuel Sanders","It's very possible that Sanders outperforms my ranking of him - but he's now 31 years old and has started to show signs of slowing down - whether it be age or injuries. His yards per target has declined each of the last three seasons - bottoming out at 6.0 yards in 2017. The upgrade in quarterback should help - though - as he was still averaging 7.7 targets per game - which ranked 17th among wide receivers. He should be considered a solid WR4 with some upside."
"Jimmy Graham","This is an interesting case - because we just saw the Packers sign a big-name free agent last year who was a massive letdown - but things have changed since that time. The biggest boost for Graham is the fact that Jordy Nelson is gone - as he was Aaron Rodgers' go-to target in the red zone - a job that can quickly become Graham's. He's not going to be the tight end who racks up 50-plus yards per game like Gronk - Kelce - or Ertz - but his touchdown numbers should be right in line with theirs. The concern with Graham is that he's going to turn 32 years old this year and showed signs of decline with an elite quarterback last year - as he failed to record more than 72 yards in any one game."
"Jamison Crowder","After the Redskins traded for Alex Smith - I knew I'd be high on Crowder. My interest only grew fonder when the Redskins brought in Paul Richardson - who should help stretch the field and open things underneath for Crowder. Smith doesn't like throwing into tight windows - as evidenced by NFL's NextGenStats that show a league-low 12 percent of his throws went to a wide receiver with one or less yard of separation. While Richardson and Josh Doctson were mediocre at separating - Crowder averaged 3.2 yards of separation - which ranked eight among wide receivers in 2017."
"Chris Hogan","Despite playing in just nine games in 2017 - Hogan managed to finish tied for 25th in red zone targets - and actually had the same amount that Brandin Cooks (12) did - despite Cooks playing all 16 games. It goes to show the confidence Tom Brady has developed with him - so by taking Hogan where he's currently going in drafts - you're getting WR2 upside at WR4/WR5 cost."
"Robert Woods","As it turns out - coaching does - in fact - matter more than most care to admit. After failing to finish as a top-40 wide receiver in any of his first four seasons - Woods finished as the WR33 in 2017 despite missing four games! His 85 targets over 12 games would extrapolate to 113.3 over a full 16-game season - though we can't automatically pencil him in for that with the arrival of Brandin Cooks. With the way their defense improved - it's unlikely that they'll be throwing any more in 2018 - so you have to keep your expectations at bay with Woods. He's likely to be on the WR3/WR4 border most weeks and offers little upside with all the playmakers on that offense."
"Kirk Cousins","Many are assuming that just because the talent around Cousins got better - that he'll produce more than he did with the Redskins. I'd hit the brakes on that assessment - as his efficiency was among the best in the game while there - and he was among the top-10 in pass attempts every season. Going to the Vikings (who threw the ball just 526 times in 2017) is going to change that - as their defense is top-three in the league - which doesn't allow shootouts. They also just lost their offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur - so it'll take some time for everyone to sync up. While Cousins should be a bit more consistent - I don't think he comes with the upside to warrant a top-eight quarterback selection."
"Devin Funchess","It seems that everyone is forgetting how much Greg Olsen means to this offense and why Funchess got the volume he did last year. While he did a solid job - the Panthers felt the need to draft a wide receiver with their first-round pick - and one who'll play the underneath possession-style role - eliminating Funchess' volume. He's going to be a lesser version of Kelvin Benjamin going forward."
"Duke Johnson","Carlos Hyde and Nick Chubb both join the fold - but Johnson has been so impressive in his role that you can count on his touches being safe. He was start-worthy as often as virtually any other running back last season. The downside is that he will be stuck in that role rather than having a chance to become a three down back."
"Randall Cobb","I get it - Cobb's career has gone downhill the past few years - but that shouldn't force you to run from him completely. The last I checked - his quarterback is still Aaron Rodgers - which means 10 touchdowns is well within reach. Even with Jordy Nelson in town last year - Cobb saw 92 targets in 15 games - showing how much he still means to the offense. While there were rumors of him being cut due to his large salary cap number - they decided to hold on for another season - and you should - too."
"Kyle Rudolph","It came out not long ago that Rudolph had offseason ankle surgery - which is now his eight surgery in the last 10 years. It hasn't affected him much over the last two years - though - as he ranks third in receptions - sixth in yards - and second in touchdowns among tight ends. He'll get an upgrade at quarterback with Kirk Cousins - though the Offensive Coordinator has also changed. You want to say that he's one of the safer TE1's in fantasy football - but it's only a matter of time before the injuries start to catch up - right?"
"Chris Thompson","Coming back from a broken leg is never going to be easy to do - as you' rather tear an ACL at this point in time. It's a shame - too - because Thompson just had a historic season. While most talk about Alvin Kamara's ridiculous efficiency - they looked over how impressive Thompson was while averaging 7.81 yards per touch - which was more than Kamara who averaged 7.73 yards per touch. It wasn't just yardage - either - as there've been 265 running backs over the last five years who've totaled at least 100 touches - and Thompson's 1.47 PPR fantasy points per touch ranked second to only Kamara in that span."
"Cooper Kupp","Despite missing Week 17 - Kupp finished as the No. 27 wide receiver in his rookie season - something that's not common in today's game. He did benefit from Robert Woods missing four games - and it now doesn't help that Brandin Cooks has been added to the mix. The part you can hang your hat on is that Kupp plays an entirely different role in the Rams offense than Cooks will - so it shouldn't affect his role too much. With Cooks - Woods - and Todd Gurley on the roster - it's going to be tough for Kupp to outperform last year's numbers without an injury."
"Tevin Coleman","Unless there's an injury to Devonta Freeman - it's hard to see Coleman living up to his current ADP - which is right around the 22nd-24th RB off the board. In games where Freeman's played all four quarters - Coleman topped 11 carries just once last season. When seeing in between 6-11 carries per game - it makes it difficult to produce massive numbers unless you're consistently scoring touchdowns at an unsustainable rate - which Coleman has. The reason you draft him is because he can give you flex-type production with Freeman - but turns into a must-start RB1 without Freeman."
"Robby Anderson","This is a ranking that can move - as Anderson could potentially be suspended by the commissioner. He's had off -the-field issues multiple times - but the most recent arrest has some really bad details - particularly when he said things to a police officer about what he'd do to his wife. He may escape legal trouble - but the NFL is sure to investigate. It could be an Ezekiel Elliott situation where we don't even know when the season begins - so you have to build that risk into his draft price. He belongs in the WR4 range because of it."
"Devante Parker","There are a lot of fantasy players who are bailing on Parker at this point in his career - and while I get why they'd want to do that - it's a mistake. He's a former first-round pick who is 6-foot-3 and 220 pounds - who has produced when he's been healthy. There've been 25 games in which he's seen at least five targets - and in those games he's averaged 68.2 yards and 0.3 touchdowns - which is low-end WR2 numbers. He did that with Jarvis Landry on the team - who is now a Cleveland Browns receiver. It's rare to find a player this late in drafts who has 120-target potential - but Parker does. If he stays healthy - he's going to finish as a top-30 wide receiver with upside for more."
"Tarik Cohen","Another team that didn't add a running back in the draft was the Bears - who will be riding the shoulders of Jordan Howard and Cohen. While they did add quite a bit of receiving talent to the roster - Cohen is a movable chess piece that Matt Nagy can have some fun with. Cohen was able to finish as the RB30 last year despite having the vanilla John Fox as his head coach."
"Matthew Stafford","It seems like Stafford is the same quarterback every year - as he's now finished in-between the QB5 and QB11 in six of the last seven seasons. Both him and Matt Ryan are the borderline QB1's that you don't LOVE drafting - but they're usually the safest picks on the board - though Stafford usually goes a bit earlier. While his overall numbers put him in the top-12 - he's been outside the top-12 in each of the last four seasons when it comes to QB1 performance percentage - as he's typically around the 37.5 percent mark."
"Rex Burkhead","Burkhead is expected to take a backseat to Sony Michel - but don't forget that Rex was useful even with Dion Lewis finishing as a top 12 fantasy running back last season. There is definitely room for him to perform in a similar fashion this year - especially if the Patriots further cut down on their pass attempts."
"Marshawn Lynch","The signing of Doug Martin makes little sense - but the fact that they held onto Lynch tells you what you need to know - he's going to play. He seemed to get better as the year went on in 2017 - finishing as the No. 11 running back from Week 9 through Week 17. Apparently Jon Gruden wants to run the ball a lot - and even though his history says different - he has the personnel to do just that. Lynch is the new version of Frank Gore with more touchdown upside."
"Julian Edelman","Edelman is suspended for the first four games of the season - so his draft stock has fallen - but when he is on the field - he always gives low-end WR2 type numbers. If you can afford to play without him for the first four weeks then you might want to make him a target."
"Marlon Mack","It's a bit difficult to know how the Colts value Marlon Mack - as they didn't attack any of the big-name running backs in free agency - but did draft two running backs in the first five rounds. He apparently had offseason shoulder surgery that he's recovering from - but the Colts backfield is one to watch in the preseason."
"Will Fuller","When Fuller returned from injury in the second half of the season - we saw a much more clear picture of who he actually is. Sure - Watson will be back - but the touchdown rate will be cut in half and Fuller is merely a lottery ticket every week."
"Trey Burton","There is no denying that Burton was a highly sought after tight end free agent this off-season. The Bears ended up signing him to a big deal and he expects to step in right away as a playmaker. With that said - going from Wentz to Trubisky is a big drop off - and now - the Bears have plenty of weapons int he passing game so Burton may be going overrated at this point. The upside is clearly there - but don't sleep on the risk."
"Sterling Shepard","Over the first two years of his career - Shepard has shown the ability to step-up and be the focal point of a passing attack - though he doesn't need to be with Odell Beckham Jr. on the field. To know that he has that ability is a bonus - though - as Beckham Jr. has dealt with injuries throughout his career. Pat Shurmur did wonders for Adam Thielen's career while working out of the slot - which is where Shepard has played over 80 percent of his snaps the last two years. He's going to give you WR4 production regardless - but has upside for more."
"Ben Roethlisberger","Did you know that Roethlisberger has been a top-8 fantasy quarterback just twice during his 14-year career? Missed games play into that a lot - but he's never been one of the elites in fantasy football. With that being said - he's finished top-10 in two of the last four seasons and may now have the best wide receiver group he's ever had in Antonio Brown - JuJu Smith-Schuster - and James Washington. The Steelers defense is in somewhat of a rebuild mode - so it shouldn't be shocking to see him in more shootouts like the one against the Jaguars in the playoffs. He's not going to be an every-week starter - but he's going to win you some weeks."
"Jordan Reed","He's not for those who are risk-adverse - as he's never played all 16 games. In fact - he has averaged just 10.4 games played over his five-year career - with a career-low of six games last year. Still - when on the field - he's been one of the top-five tight ends in the game - and the arrival of Alex Smith doesn't hurt at all - as he's produced a couple top-five tight ends in his time."
"Marquise Goodwin","Goodwin is one of the tougher players to project this season - as the 49ers will be welcoming Pierre Garcon back to the lineup - they added Jerick McKinnon in free agency - and they traded up in the second-round to snag Dante Pettis. Still - Goodwin was the alpha-dog for Jimmy Garoppolo last year - totaling 51 targets - 34 receptions - 545 yards - and two touchdowns over the final seven games of the season. You have to wonder if that chemistry carries over into this season - or was it more of a there's really no one else to throw to scenario? There's risk with drafting him as a top-30 wide receiver - but if you get him around the WR40 range - you can afford to take that risk."
"Andrew Luck","Let's be real about this - nobody outside of Andrew Luck knows whether or not he can return to form. It's possible that it may take time for him to come around - and it's unlikely we get a large preview in the preseason. Because of that - he needs to be lowered on your draft board. When taking Luck - you're going to have to draft another quarterback to your squad - unless we've seen him throw extensively. Prior to hurting his shoulder - Luck finished as a top-four quarterback in three of his last four seasons."
"Nelson Agholor","For someone who ranked 50th in targets per game among wide receivers last year - Agholor is getting a lot of love in early drafts. Knowing that - tied in with the fact that Carson Wentz will regress in the touchdown department - and you have yourself a recipe for disaster when taking him as a top-35 wide receiver (as he's currently being drafted)."
"Kerryon Johnson","While I'm typically pretty aggressive in my pursuit of high-round rookie running backs - Johnson has the toughest backfield to project. Not only did the Lions draft Johnson in the second-round - but they also snagged LeGarrette Blount in free agency. If there's one thing Blount does well - it's handle early-down work. If there's anything Theo Riddick does - it's handle third-down work. Do you see where this is going? Johnson is probably the best all-around running back on the roster - but they aren't benching Blount or Riddick - so he'll be left to battle for touches. Oh - and don't completely write-off Ameer Abdullah - who still has the possibility of being traded."
"Jordy Nelson","After being a top-three fantasy receiver two straight years - Nelson disappeared last year - posting more than 100 fewer points than the previous year and finishing as a WR5. Now that he is in a new offense and playing in the slot - we might see him split the difference in half."
"Jimmy Garoppolo","There's a lot of hype surrounding Garoppolo - who finished the season with a bang. His 8.8 yards per attempt ranks as third-best of any quarterback who's thrown the ball at least 100 times in the last five years. With that being said - he did finish with just 7 touchdowns and 5 interceptions in five starts - so it wasn't all coming together just yet. He lacks a true No. 1 receiver - which may hurt his overall touchdown numbers - and he doesn't offer any rushing upside - as he's rushed for just 17 yards in his seven NFL starts. There's definitely a chance that he gets into QB1 territory - but you shouldn't pay for that just yet."
"Jack Doyle","This is - quite obviously - one of the most difficult players to forecast. Not only does Andrew Luck's shoulder linger over Doyle's production - but the Colts made a move for Eric Ebron who is one of just 14 tight ends all-time to receive for over 2,000 yards before his 25th birthday. There is a chance that Doyle finishes as a top five tight end and also a decent chance he is entirely irrelevant. I don't mind buying a lottery ticket - just be aware that it is what we are getting out of Doyle."
"Philip Rivers","Facts are facts and Rivers has now finished as a top-12 quarterback in eight of the last 10 seasons. He's got one of the better offensive lines in football and his weapons have never been better than they are right now. There's not enough love for the boring low-end QB1."
"Kelvin Benjamin","Let me be clear - I'm not a fan of Benjamin the player - but I am a fan of the targets he'll see with no other viable wide receiver in Buffalo. It was the reason he saw 115-plus targets in Carolina - and the quarterback situation wasn't much better (from an accuracy standpoint) - but he was able to finish as a top-24 receiver multiple times. Targets first - talent second in fantasy football. As long as Benjamin shows he's healthy when drafts start taking place - he's worthy of a top-40 wide receiver pick."
"Isaiah Crowell","It is assumed by most that Crowell will be handed the starting job with the Jets since he is the only back on the roster who has done it before - but there is a reason the Browns didn't bring him back. He hasn't been any good - so even if he is the lead back - his ceiling is that of a flex."
"Kenny Stills","Without looking - where do you think Stills would rank among wide receivers in yards and touchdowns over the last two years? I bet you didn't think he was 32nd in yards and 9th in touchdowns. Even though I believe Devante Parker has a career-year - there's plenty of targets to go around - as the Dolphins were one of just three teams who had three receivers with more than 80 targets - and they were the only team with three wide receivers who had 96 or more targets. With Jarvis Landry out - Stills' target ceiling is likely around 115."
"Jamaal Williams","Part of the reason analysts are predicting that Aaron Jones will win the job is because of Williams' inability to create big plays. He had just one run of more than 15 yards (25 yards) on 153 carries - the worst big-play rate in the NFL. He did show the ability to carry the ball 20-plus times per game and the offensive line was a bit dinged up - so don't simply dismiss him - either. Taking him outside the top-30 running backs isn't bad - as there's legitimate top-10 upside with any starting running back in the Packers offense. Just know that he's got very-high bust potential as well."
"Marqise Lee","Most don't seem to know that despite missing two games in 2017 that Lee ranks 27th in targets among wide receivers over the last two years. Keep in mind that Allen Robinson was healthy and played the entire 2016 season - so this is noteworthy. The Jaguars let Robinson walk - but retained Lee on a four-year - $34 million contract - which wasn't far off what Robinson got with the Bears. I he stays healthy - he's locked into 100-plus targets - which is why he should be considered a borderline WR3 with some upside if Blake Bortles continues to improve."
"Rishard Matthews","Despite Marcus Mariota getting hurt in 2016 and struggling through much of 2017 - Matthews remained consistent in his production - hauling in 61 percent of his passes for 14.5 and 15.0 yards per reception in each year. The area his production dipped - though - was targets and touchdowns. With Corey Davis slated for a bigger role in 2018 - you should expect that decline to continue - though Matthews won't go away - as he's been extremely efficient with his targets. He's comparable to the Titans version of DeSean Jackson."
"George Kittle","When you watch Kittle play - it is easy to imagine him morphing into a star tight end with Jimmy G. The matter of the fact is - however - that he was merely mediocre with Jimmy under center. The majority of Kittle's production came when his college teammate - C.J. Beathard was the one throwing passes. That isn't to say things can't change over the off-season - but just know that drafting Kittle as a TE1 is no sure thing."
"Carlos Hyde","He's someone I was targeting in best-ball leagues as a low-end RB2 just a couple weeks ago - as I do believe the Browns are going to be run-heavy in 2018. While that's still going to be the case - them drafting Nick Chubb in the second-round was the worst-case scenario for Hyde (outside of them taking Saquon Barkley). Chubb is essentially a younger version of Hyde - but faster. I still believe Hyde gets 10-12 touches per game - but it's not enough to crack the top-30 running backs."
"C.J. Anderson","Most thought it was a terrible landing spot for Anderson in Carolina - but it was likely the best-case scenario. Most don't realize that Jonathan Stewart totaled 198 carries last year - which ranked inside the top-20 at the position. Anderson has always been one of the most efficient runners on first- and second-down while playing behind a mediocre offensive line. If he reaches the same amount of carries that Stewart did - he's going to finish as a top-24 running back. The best part is that you don't have to spend even a top-30 running back pick on him."
"Jared Goff","Last season - Goff managed to finish the year as a QB1 - but then again - so did Bortles so that really shouldn't mean too much. In fact - his touchdown rate was inflated - the Rams lost Sammy Watkins and he threw only 477 passes. Goff shouldn't be considered much more than a game manager."
"Matt Ryan","The addition of Calvin Ridley bumped Ryan's stock up just a bit - enough to move him ahead of guys like Jared Goff and Jimmy Garoppolo. Ryan isn't going to be the top fantasy quarterback that he was in 2016 - but he's someone you should be happy to roster if you're waiting until the late rounds to draft your quarterback."
"Allen Hurns","The word is that Hurns is the Cowboys' clear-cut number one receiver as of now. He has produced before in an expanded role so it isn't crazy to see him performing as a flex play from week to week now that Dak is his QB."
"Patrick Mahomes","There is plenty of hype surrounding Mahomes after one big game. Let's not forget Matt Flynn - though - who was similar before busting. Yes - he has weapons to throw to and a huge arm - but there are also question marks that leave Mahomes as a major risk too."
"Marcus Mariota","Mariota showed significant upside two seasons ago when he was the QB1 for an eight-week stretch. Last year was a trainwreck - however - as he finished QB18. His ceiling is much higher than that - but the floor is a disaster - making him only a streamer for the time being."
"Theo Riddick","The Lions backfield is loaded with a bunch of decent backs who are all about on the same level. It will be tough for most of them to find touches except for Riddick who has his job locked in. Expect much of the same - making him a solid depth piece to fill in during bye weeks and injuries."
"Ty Montgomery","The Packers have made it clear that Montgomery will have a sizeable role in the Packers' offense - but that it will primarily be on third down. While this certainly caps his upside - it gives enough safety that you can draft him as a reliable depth piece - and who knows if he might just end up winning the #1 job back one way or another."
"David Njoku","I'm a big fan of Njoku the player - but I don't see where or how he finishes as a top-15 tight end with all the other talent on the roster. Not only are the Browns going to be run-heavy - but they need to find a way to keep Jarvis Landry - Josh Gordon - and Corey Coleman involved. Because of that - his targets aren't going to be where they need to be."
"Giovani Bernard","Mixon should be the primary back and may even end up as a bell-cow for the Bengals. With that said - Bernard has always performed well in a limited roll and did post 158 yards in Week 16 - so there seems to be a chance that Cincy would give him another opportunity to shine in a larger role."
"Josh Doctson","We didn't get the best numbers from Doctson - so it makes sense why many will be avoiding him - but do consider that he is the Redskins' top receiver - and that is exactly why defenses focused on locking him down with their shadow corners. He had the single toughest set of matchups last season and as that lets up - we should see plenty of production."
"Nick Chubb","The Browns may have drafted Chubb early - and he certainly looks impressive on tape - but don't overlook the fact that Carlos Hyde was extremely good last season. It won't be an easy task for Chubb to take over as the starter - and even if he does - don't expect a workhorse type of workload. Don't forget that Duke Johnson is plenty impressive himself too."
"James White","While Rex Burkhead is still is town and Sony Michel joined the group - remember that it was James White who finished the season getting goal-line work. If it carries over into the season - he would make for a terrific flex player week to week seeing that he also gets targets in the passing game."
"Dak Prescott","Dak's awful season actually ended with him finishing as a top 10 fantasy QB ahead of Big Ben. With Zeke back in the lineup full time and a healthy offensive line - he may just return to the level of production we saw his rookie season."
"Alex Smith","Most people say that 2017 was an outlier year for Smith - and while it's hard to disagree that it was better than the rest - he's been doing this for a while now. Since 2011 - Smith has thrown 132 touchdowns compared to just 43 interceptions. In that period - there are just two quarterbacks who have a better TD:INT ratio than him: Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady. You don't do that over a seven-year period if you're a mediocre quarterback. With Jay Gruden's history with Kirk Cousins - it's very possible that we're underestimating Smith's fantasy potential. If you're the type to grab two quarterbacks in a draft - Smith would make an excellent No. 2."
"Devontae Booker","While it seems that the Broncos drafted Royce Freeman to jump in as the lead-back from Week 1 - it is far from certain at this point. Booker is said to have a shot at the job - so keep an eye out and draft him in the meantime as a shot in the dark."
"DeSean Jackson","When you watch as much football as I do - you see some things that some people may have missed. When it comes to Jackson - he and Jameis Winston were just a touch off on connecting for multiple 40-plus yard touchdowns - which would have dramatically changed how fantasy players valued him this offseason. There were four passes that I can recall right now that were within a yard or two of his hands that might turn into long touchdowns this year. Even in what was a down year for him - he produced WR3 numbers 50 percent of the time - which ranked 33rd among wide receivers."
"D.J. Moore","Cam Newton may be an exceptional football player - but passer he is not. There are only so many targets to go around between Greg Olsen - Christian McCaffrey and Devin Funchess so while Moore is a terrific talent - he may not offer startable production right away for fantasy purposes."
"Charles Clay","Clay may not have finished with the best numbers last season - but prior to his injury - the Bills were peppering him with targets. Once he returned - Clay wasn't quite himself - but over the final three weeks of the season - he saw another 27 targets which has to encourage fantasy owners. Add in the fact that the Bills still have no receiving weapons and Clay doesn't make a bad tight end in deep leagues or best ball contests."
"Aaron Jones","If Aaron Jones wins the three-down back job outright - we are looking at a potential top 5 fantasy back. Chances are - however - that this scenario won't play out - despite his talent. The Green Bay staff has made it clear they intend on using a committee involving all three backs. If this is the case when Jones comes back from suspension - he is merely a week to week flex. Jones is still worth drafting based on the upside - though."
"Cameron Meredith","Although Meredith is far from a sure thing - the word is that he is recovering well from surgery and should be good to go this season. Now that he is on Drew Brees' team - big things could be in store if he gets a chance at the starting wide receiver two job. Consider him to be a late-end lottery ticket."
"O.J. Howard","Howard was unbelieveably efficient last season with 432 yards and 6 touchdowns in just 39 targets. Granted - that touchdown rate is nearly impossible to repeat - but it goes without saying that his target total will at least double if the Bucs know what is good for them. In standard leagues - he was only 30 fantasy points behind Evan Engram despite 76 fewer targets."
"Kenny Golladay","Golden Tate has 90+ receptions each of the last four years - Marvin Jones was a top five receiver and while Eric Ebron is now gone - Theo Riddick will still command targets too. It isn't as though Golladay isn't talented - but the ceiling is limited unless one of these key pieces suffers an injury."
"Tyler Eifert","Sure - there is a chance we see another 140 point fantasy season from Eifert - but even that 2015 output appeared to be a fluke. He had an absurd touchdown rate and just 615 receiving yards. More likely - we will see the version who has missed significant time in three of the past four seasons. Rememeber - nobody wanted him in free agency so he crawled back to the Bengals. That should tell you most everything you need to know."
"Eric Ebron","It may be tempting - but don't be so quick to give up on Ebron. Since 2000 - only Gronk - Tony Gonzalez - Jason Witten and Jeremy Shockey have as many receiving yards as Ebron before their 25th birthdays. Obviously - Ebron will have to overtake Doyle before having much relevance - but there is a shot it happens and thus - a shot Ebron morphs into a top-five fantasy tight end with Andrew Luck throwing him the ball."
"Mohamed Sanu","While I've got Calvin Ridley higher in my rankings - Sanu is the safer draft pick. He's a proven veteran who knows the offense - and posted WR3 numbers in 67 percent of his games last year - which ranked 13th among wide receivers. He doesn't have much upside - but if you're looking for a safe - high-floor type producer - Sanu is your guy."
"Jaguars","It's not often that I'd support the idea of drafting a defense before the final round - but the Jaguars are a slightly different animal. They are one of the most dominant defenses we've seen in their lifetime - they haven't lost any of their important pieces - and they're extremely young."
"Dez Bryant","As it stands now - Green Bay and Seattle seem like the most obvious fits for a Dez landing spot. If either comes to fruition - we would be talking about a WR2 once again - but if he goes to a less ideal location - he ought to be regarded as a touchdown dependant WR3 or flex play."
"Cameron Brate","If the Bucs hadn't just signed Brate to a big-time contract - I'd be ready to fade Brate - considering how excellent O.J. Howard was once he took over. The Bucs did sign Brate - however - and Jameis positively loves him. When Jameis was the starting QB - Brate was a top four fantasy tight end last season. In fact - in the six games Brate started - the Harvard grad was a top 12 tight end even more often than Gronk."
"Bilal Powell","It's not an ideal situation in New York - but if you really think they'll lean on Isaiah Crowell more than they did Matt Forte - you're going about this the wrong way. Powell should at least have the same role he had last year - if not more. He finished as the RB26 - less than double his current cost. He's not someone who will win you your fantasy league - but he can most definitely play a role."
"Jared Cook","It is hard not to like the weapons Cook is competiting with from Amari Cooper and Jordy Nelson to Martavis Bryant - but Cook was seventh in receiving yards last season so he is definitley still a fantasy asset. Granted - Derek Carr has taken a big step back so there will only be so many touchdowns to go around - but you'd expect Cook to improve on the two he posted last year - and if he had even three - we would have been looking at a top 12 fantasy tight end."
"Corey Clement","It seemed that Clement started to pick up steam in his pursuit for more snaps as the year went on - but he never topped 28 snaps. Keep in mind that's with Darren Sproles missing essentially the entire season - and he's been brought back in 2018. Between Sproles - Jay Ajayi - and Clement - this is going to be a wildly inconsistent backfield for fantasy purposes. He's nothing more than a bench-stash who has value should something happen to Ajayi or Sproles."
"Nyheim Hines","Say hello to the next Darren Sproles. He doesn't have the upside of a D'Onta Foreman who could be a workhorse running back in the right scenario - but Hines is a good bet to contribute in the passing game each and every week so if you are in a deeper league - don't hesitate to add him."
"Tyler Lockett","Some are scared of Brandon Marshall signing - but you shouldn't be one of them - as I don't even think he's a lock to make the roster. Lockett isn't someone I'd chase in drafts - but he plays with Russell Wilson - has flashed before - and the touchdowns have to go somewhere. His price doesn't reflect any of that."
"Calvin Ridley","Although Ridley wasn't drafted as the top receiver in the class - he is certainly the most polished. Sure - he's got a guy named Julio Jones hogging targets in his offense - but Ridley should start from the get-go and is playing with the MVP from two seasons ago."
"Derek Carr","This time last year - Carr was the fourth quarterback off the board. He struggled through injuries last season and finished as the QB21. In 2016 - however - he was a top 10 QB so you'd have to think it will end up somewhere in between - making him merely a streamer for the time being."
"Austin Seferian-Jenkins","Early reports indicate that ASJ has quickly become Blake Bortles' favorite target. This should come as no surprise considering run-blocking 33-year-old Marcedes Lewis has five touchdowns for the Jags last season. ASJ is a significantly better weapon and has a chance to finally realize his potential this season in an offense that has lackluster receiving and tight-end friendly quarterback."
"Paul Richardson","Although it appears Crowder and Doctson are the Redskins' top two receivers - the fact that they went out and spent 40 million on Richardson has to turn some heads. Even if he does wrestle away snaps from them - however - Alex Smith is expected to throw fewer pass attempts than Kirk Cousins this year so the pie is smaller."
"Mitch Trubisky","The Bears are expected to let Trubisky loose this season with the additions of Matt Nagy - Allen Robinson and Trey Burton. He could be this year's Jared Goff - but that doesn't mean you should draft him with that expectation. There is plenty of risk as well."
"D'Onta Foreman","Foreman has enormous upside as a breakout candidate - but first he will have to manage to bounce back completely from a torn achillies - which is a tough task - unseat Lamar Miller - then hope Watson is himself again. That seems like a tall task - but the lottery ticket is worth the risk."
"Blake Bortles","You may want to give up on Bortles - but he has now been a QB1 three consecutive seasons and managed to be the #2 QB over the final five weeks of the season. It is never pretty - but he gets the job done from a production perspective."
"Anthony Miller","Many are clamoring for Miller to get big targets as a rookie in Chicago - but there are a few problems with that notion. First - Trubisky has some major question marks. Additionally - Allen Robinson - Trey Burton - Taylor Gabriel - Tarik Cohen and Kevin White are all going to be seeing targets too. Miller may have value - but his upside is limited."
"Chris Carson","Although the Seahawks just spent serious draft capital on a running back - it is growing more difficult to ignore the reports about Chris Carson excelling this off-season. Pete Carroll is not afraid to give the better man the job and accept a sunken cost."
"Eli Manning","Manning finished as the #23 QB last year but with Beckham gone and Saquon not yet in place. The Giants patched up their offensive line and should be much more competitive this year so don't hesitate to use Eli in a few streaming opportunities over the course of the year."
"Latavius Murray","Dalvin Cook was an absolute bell-cow for the Vikings before his injury - but a lot of that may have been because Murray was injured. There is a possibility that Murray has a role in a split backfield sort of situation and gets some goal-line carries. Plus - just imagine how Murray would perform if Cook was hurt and McKinnon now out of his way."
"Jameis Winston","Winston is suspended for three weeks so he is undraftable outside of two-qb leagues. When he returns - however - we are looking at a top-10 quarterback. He was superb last season when healthy and still getting better."
"Matt Breida","The 49ers paid big bucks for Jerick McKinnon - but they also didn't draft a running back which means Shanahan is comfortable with Breida as his number two. Remember that Tevin Coleman was created by Shanahan's offense and that Breida is an even better athlete."
"Mike Williams","Last season - Williams only gave fantasy owners one game with more than 2 receptions. That doesn't mean he is a bust - however. Rather - with a full off-season to work with the offense and play healthy - Williams could take a big step forward - especially with Hunter Henry out for the year."
"Tyrell Williams","Mike Williams is expected to start with Keenan Allen - but now that Hunter Henry is gone and the Chargers didn't replace him - we might end up seeing Williams get enough targets to monitor for fantasy purposes. There will be some weeks where he posts big numbers - so queue him up in best ball formats."
"Ricky Seals-Jones","Seals-Jones is an elite athlete who excelled in spurts last season - but hardly saw the field enough to make a difference. If that should change this pre-season - he would be an immidiate top sleeper candidate all across the industry since Arizona lost so many targets and upgraded at quarterback."
"Ted Ginn","Another year with Drew Brees - yet his cost is down? Well - to be fair - Ginn is now 33 years old and the Saints have added a lot of new pieces around him. Cameron Meredith was a pretty solid signing - as was drafting Tre'Quan Smith - who is known as a downfield receiver. We also cannot forget the addition of Ben Watson - who is sure to see more targets than Coby Fleener did the last two seasons. There were just five games where Ginn saw more than five targets last year - meaning his fantasy production is going to be sporadic. He also caught a ridiculous 76 percent of passes - which was far more than his previous career-high of 58 percent - so you're looking at some regression. He's a guy you plug in for bye weeks and hope you get one of his better performances."
"Kenneth Dixon","Had Dixon not suffered a season-ending injury last season - we may just be talking about him as a top 15 running back headed into this fantasy season. The fact is that Baltimore raved about him so don't be shocked if he gets a crack at considerable touches even with Alex Collins ahead of him for now."
"Benjamin Watson","Watson is old as dirt - but he was remarkably efficient last year even with Joe Flacco - posting a huge 77.2% catch rate for 522 yards and 4 touchdowns on just 79 targets. Now that he is returning to New Orleans - where Drew Brees loves to pass to tight ends - we may just see Watson return to the 110 targets and #8 tight end finish that Watson posted in the same offense during the 2015 season."
"Austin Ekeler","It seemed that while the Chargers used Ekeler in an extended role while Melvin Gordon was dinged up last year - they wanted to upgrade their depth chart. While some will see that they didn't draft a running back until the seventh-round and think Ekeler is fine - you have to know that Justin Jackson (that pick) would've gone earlier if he didn't have so much mileage on his body. He was best-suited for a backup role - while Ekeler is likely the new Branden Oliver."
"Michael Gallup","It is hard to believe Gallup fell as far in the draft as he did - but the Cowboys have to be thrilled. Apparently they are in love with him and intend on using him from day one. Don't forget that Dak Prescott was a top 10 fantasy QB last year even though he had a rough season. Those yards and TDs have to go somewhere."
"Case Keenum","John Elway did not go get a quarterback in the draft because he appears to be confident in what Keenum offers. Now - he isn't start worthy every week - but with Thomas and Sanders in the receiver core - there will be a couple starts this season that he provides useful performances."
"Martavis Bryant","We've seen Bryant as a fringe WR2 while sharing targets with two of the best players in football. Now that he is in Oakland with just Amari Cooper and an old Jordy Nelson - his ceiling takes another step forward. First - however - he will have to get on the field and stay clean."
"Doug Martin","Martin has been an RB1 multiple times in his career and it wouldn't surprise anyone if he suddenly returned to that type of production. With that said - he should also be considered the underdog to win the starting job with Marshawn Lynch on the roster. Even if he does - it would likely be a split workload."
"LeGarrette Blount","Potentially the worst landing spot for someone with his skill-set - as players who don't participate in the passing-game don't stay on the field under Jim Bob Cooter. It's possible that new head coach Matt Patricia wanted Blount from his days in New England - but when they drafted Kerryon Johnson in the second-round - it pretty much buried the hope for Blount. He may score from time-to-time - but you're better off letting someone else draft him."
"Austin Hooper","We know Hooper has plenty of upside - but with the addition of Calvin Ridley - it seems unlikely that his target share will improve much more - if at all. Unless they start throwing Hooper the ball - he has essentially zero fantasy value."
"Frank Gore","You want to say that Gore wouldn't have gone to the Dolphins to just sit on the bench in his final year - but it's hard seeing him receive many touches with youngsters Kenyan Drake and Kalen Ballage on the roster. But still - why would the Dolphins sign him if they weren't planning on at least using him in a 8-10 touch per game role? It's an odd situation for sure - but knowing that Gore has averaged just 3.8 yards per carry over the last three years makes your life easier. His best days are behind him and he's playing behind what will be one of the worst offensive lines in his career. You're better off looking for someone who presents actual upside late in drafts."
"Andy Dalton","Dalton has never finished worse than QB18 through his first seven seasons so it should come as a surprise if it happens that way this year. He is without question among the worst starters in football - but he gets the job done well enough to start most weeks in two-QB leagues."
"Dede Westbrook","There are some in the industry who adore Westbrook - but most see him as the clear-cut fourth wide receiver in a weak passing offense. Obviously if the second is correct - there is no value unless someone gets injured. He isn't the worst possible late-round pick - however - as there is some upside."
"Peyton Barber","Some are still expecting Barber to start for the Bucs - eh? When you draft a running back at the top of the second-round - call me skeptical. Whether or not you like it - draft stock matters. Barber is a formerly undrafted free agent who the Bucs let sit on the bench while Doug Martin and Charles Sims combined for 1071 yards on 354 carries over the last two years. That amounts to just 3.03 yards per carry. While Barber played better - they obviously felt the need to invest in Ronald Jones. He's just the handcuff - guys."
"T.J. Yeldon","While there is no guarantee of an injury to any one player - they do happen - and Fournette is among the most injury prone running backs in the game. If he were to go down at some point - Yeldon would likely be a top 20 running back right away - plus he is useful in the passing game even if no injury happens all season."
"Jordan Matthews","While Julian Edelman is out for the first four games - Matthews expects to see a larger role with the Patriots. We've seen Tom Brady turn lesser players into household names - and if Matthews can get off to a hot start - don't be surprised if they keep him on the field."
"Vance McDonald","It is no guarantee that the Steelers will give McDonald the starting job - but should he take it over from Jesse James - we would be looking at a breakout candidate with top 10 tight end upside. McDonald is a capable athlete who could certainly excel in the red zone of Big Ben's offense."
"Mike Gesicki","He's an athletic freak who can do things most human beings cannot - though we mustn't forget that he's still a rookie tight end and he's got a lot to learn. The reason for some optimism - however - is that the Dolphins don't really have another tight end on the roster who is a clear-cut starter to force Gesicki out of the lineup. On top of that - the exit of Jarvis Landry and Julius Thomas frees up over 220 targets in the passing attack. There's reason for optimism - but history tells us to be weary of rookie tight ends."
"Darren Sproles","Sproles may be old - but he has been an RB3 or better in 5 of the past 6 years he was healthy including two years ago. The Eagles are saying he will start - and while his workload will clearly be limited - it should be enough to warrant flex starts once the bye weeks and injuries roll in."
"Chris Ivory","Chris Ivory would be expected to step into a much larger role should LeSean McCoy end up suspended or cut as a result of the allegations. He isn't the most talented player - nor is he in a strong offense - but there is no subsitute for touches."
"Chris Godwin","Last season - Godwin was extremely efficient with his targets. Now that he is starting - those targets should increase and we could see a breakout. He still has Mike Evans - DeSean Jackson and two strong tight ends to share work with - however - so that breakout comes with a capped ceiling."
"Tyrod Taylor","Tyrod has never had weapons like this - yet has always managed to be a sufficient fantasy asset. Feel free to use him until his time as the starter runs out - especially in two-qb leagues. He will go undrafted in most leagues - but makes for a great streamer at times."
"Quincy Enunwa","Josh McCown was actually really good last season and seeing that he is starting again in 2018 and that Robby Anderson is likely to be suspended - Enunwa just might be the #1 in that offense. He has been plenty useful before and might return flex value if he gets the targets."
"Donte Moncrief","Apparently - the Jags are going to start Moncrief over Dede Westbrook and DJ Chark. If that is the case then he has some value - but moving from Andrew Luck to Blake Bortles and an offense who wants to run as often as possible limits his upside."
"Danny Amendola","There were some crazy rumors coming out of Miami early in the offseason suggesting that Amendola would see 100-plus targets in Jarvis Landry's old role. The issue with that was that the Dolphins signed Albert Wilson before him - and for much more money. Amendola will turn 33 years old this year and is not built for that type of role - as shown by the fact that he's failed to top 689 yards in his career - and has played 16 games just twice. He may have a higher floor than most in his range - but his ceiling isn't what some are making it out to be."
"Christian Kirk","The Cardinals lost over 200 targets this off-season and someone will have to step up as the Cardinals' number two wide receiver. Granted - doing it as a rookie is always a challenge - but there is little doubting that he is the second most talented receiver on the team so this will be a battle to watch closely in the preseason."
"Javorius Allen","It's unlikely that Allen sees the field a whole lot in 2018 - unless the Ravens have completely moved on from Kenneth Dixon. Going back to the 2016 season - Allen touched the ball just 12 times. The Danny Woodhead injury at the start of 2017 definitely meant he needed to get more involved - but there are no guarantees this season. He's just a bench stash at this point."
"Mike Wallace","Why do I feel like every time I see Mike Wallace's name - I think of the song End of the Road? It's been such a long career for Wallace at a high-level of production - but starting over with another new team at the age of 32? It feels like he's a slight upgrade over Torrey Smith's role on the team last year - leaving him off the fantasy radar. If something should happen to Alshon Jeffery - though - Wallace would be an immediate waiver wire add."
"Ryan Tannehill","Tannehill may have lost Jarvis Landry - but the Dolphins picked up some extra weapons too. If he is healthy - he is a safe bet for 4,000 yards. You can't start him every week even in two-QB leagues - but there will be more than a handful of matchups where you might want to consider him."
"Keelan Cole","There are questions about how many snaps Cole will get each game in a crowded Jags' receiving core - but it shouldn't go overlooked that he led the NFL in receiving yards over the last five weeks of the season. He could breakout if he gets the opportunity."
"Jordan Wilkins","It isn't though Wilkins is some elite talent - although he seems to be underrated in that department too. Rather - Wilkins is worth drafting primarily because of the situation in Indy. Marlon Mack may not be able to handle a three-down workload which might just leave first and second down in Andrew Luck's offense open to Wilkins. Watch this one closely in case we get another Alfred Morris rookie season out of Wilkins here."
"Jermaine Kearse","It's rare to see a wide receiver see 102 targets in a season - only to be cut the next - but it seems like a realistic possibility for Kearse. If released - the Jets would take no cap hit - and they have a pretty crowded room of wide receivers. He is a veteran presence - but on a rebuilding team - they may lean on others to fill that role. You should be avoiding Kearse in early drafts."
"Geronimo Allison","Possibly fantasy football's best kept secret to this point - as you have the chance to get one of Aaron Rodgers' starting wide receivers essentially for free. With Randall Cobb playing the slot almost exclusively - Allison would start opposite Davante Adams in 2WR sets. Did everyone forget that James Jones caught 14 touchdowns from Aaron Rodgers a handful of years ago - only to retire a few years later? Allison has played 15 total games with Rodgers under center - and in those games he's totaled 45 targets - 26 receptions - 381 yards - and two touchdowns. That's some pretty good point-per-target production - and despite them drafting a few wide receivers - he's the only one who has experience in the offense - chemistry with Rodgers - and production to show he's capable."
"Albert Wilson","Wilson figures to fit into the slot in this Dolphins offense and just remember what Jarvis Landry did out of the spot. Now - Wilson is not as talented as Landry - but there are plenty of targets to be had and Wilson figures to step into enough of them to be a safe depth piece."
"Brandon Marshall","At this point - you shouldn't even be convinced that Marshall makes the Seahawks 53-man roster. At the moment he signed with them - he acknowledged he's not in football shape and has a long way to go. It's likely that Jaron Brown winds up as the better fantasy option."
"Hayden Hurst","While I'm typically against drafting rookie tight ends - Hurst may be an exception to the rule. He's already 25 years old - so it's unlikely the Ravens want to waste his prime athletically. Next - it's not an offense that favors the wide receivers. In fact - it's one that favors the tight end position - which is likely why the Ravens also added Mark Andrews in the third-round. Ravens tight ends have accounted for 285 targets - 214 receptions - 1740 yards - and 10 touchdowns over the last two seasons - and that was with Dennis Pitta (who hadn't played football in years) and 37-year-old Ben Watson as the featured players. Hurst's ball-tracking is on a different level than most rookies - so don't be shocked to see him walk into 80-plus targets in year-one."
"Corey Coleman","It seems for now that Coleman is the odd man out with Josh Gordon now back and Jarvis Landry joining Cleveland - but as we've seen many times before - that can change quickly. If it should - whether it be an injury or suspension - Coleman is exceptionally talented and could certainly bloom into a week to week fantasy starter."
"John Brown","At this point - we have to admit that Brown is among the most injury-prone players in football - and while we don't want to see anything happen - you of course have to keep it in mind. If he plays - we might get a WR3 performance - but remember that Joe Flacco is the one throwing the footballs."
"Wayne Gallman","It's pretty sad to see Gallman's value go from usable bye-week filler to third on the depth chart - though that's what happened when the Giants drafted Saquon Barkley and snagged Jonathan Stewart in free agency. Truth be told - though - I'd rather own Gallman than Stewart - as Gallman can contribute in the passing-game and is much more versatile. Whatever the case - he's only going to be usable if Barkley were to miss time."
"Cole Beasley","After posting at least 41 yards in 13-of-16 games in 2016 - Beasley hit that mark just one time in 2017 and finished with a measly 314 yards. The Cowboys offense was a mess in 2017 and it's likely to be again in 2018 - but the loss of Dez Bryant and Jason Witten could provide Beasley with more targets. Still - he's a low-upside target late in drafts - but one you can use if you're in a pinch."
"Samaje Perine","After being selected in the fourth-round of last year's draft - the Redskins apparently saw all they needed to see last year. Perine plodded his way to just 3.4 yards per carry and scoring one touchdown on 175 carries. Both he and Rob Kelley failed to distance themselves from each other - even when Chris Thompson went down with a season-ending injury. Because of that - the Redskins drafted Derrius Guice in the second-round in this year's draft. Perine is just a low-upside backup."
"Spencer Ware","Kareem Hunt took the world by storm last year - but it was no different than what Ware did prior to his concussion in 2016. Now that he is returning from injury - don't discount the potential of Ware splitting the Chiefs' running back duties - as Andy Reid has been known to allow in the past."
"Kalen Ballage","When you see Ballage - you'll say to yourself - he's a running back?" He's a massive young man (6-2 - 228) who excels in the passing-game - though he struggles in-between the tackles. Similar things were said about David Johnson when he came into the league - but Johnson has shown to be an effective runner. Ballage has to compete with Kenyan Drake and Frank Gore for touches - but he should get 4-6 touches per game out of the gate. If he impresses - he could earn more work."
"Elijah McGuire","Don't sleep on McGuire having an outside chance at winning the starting role outright for the Jets. As it looks now - Isaiah Crowell and Bilal Powell are probably ahead of him - but the job is open for competition and we've heard enough good things about McGuire that the possibility of him becoming fantasy relevant is quite realistic."
"Luke Willson","It seemed like the Lions would add a tight end in the draft after cutting Eric Ebron - but Willson is the clear-cut starter as we head into the season. The Lions seemed to focus on using Ebron a lot more last year - though that may have had to do with trying to boost his trade value. Whatever the case - Willson will have the biggest role of his career - though it's likely not enough to be a weekly fantasy contributor."
"Joe Flacco","If there was ever one thing that Flacco had going for him - it was job stability. You knew that by drafting him as your No. 2 quarterback in a 2QB league - he wasn't going to get benched. Now that the Ravens have drafted Lamar Jackson - those days are over. Flacco did get some increased weaponry in Michael Crabtree - John Brown - Hayden Hurst - Mark Andrews - and Willie Snead - but is it too little - too late? He's now finished as the QB20 or worse in three straight seasons and it's hard to trust him as anything more than a streaming QB2."
"C.J. Prosise","If you could go back and read some of the blurbs on Prosise from the last two years - you'd wonder why everyone has forgotten about him. He was touted as a David Johnson-type running back who was a better receiver than he was a runner - which made sense having formerly played wide receiver at Notre Dame. He's the best pass-catcher in the Seahawks backfield and has produced while on the field - so I wouldn't simply forget about him. If he can stay healthy - he could turn out to be a Gio Bernard-type producer for them."
"Ameer Abdullah","There is a chance that Abdullah gets cut - since it seems the Lions can't keep both Abdullah and Blount. Ameer isn't the favorite to win the job - but the battle also isn't set - so while he may be cut - he may also find a way into substantial touches should Kerryon disappoint in training camp and/or pre-season."
"Ryan Grant","We haven't seen much from Grant yet and he isn't an elite athlete - but he is starting in Andrew Luck's offense - and the last time Luck was healthy - he produced 356 fantasy points in one season. There is huge potential with Grant even if he is a mediocre talent."
"Terrelle Pryor","Pryor has both elite athleticism and a big season in his past. Don't be surprised if he wins a starting job in New York and bounces back. He will have to get healthy first - however - which at this point looks like it may still be a while."
"Willie Snead","I'm not sure if even Snead realizes how good he had it with Drew Brees - but the targets are going to be even cloudier in Baltimore now that they've added Michael Crabtree - John Brown - Hayden Hurst - Mark Andrews - Jaleel Scott - and Jordan Lasley this offseason. Think of him as the Cole Beasley of the Ravens offense - but with better talent around him and a worse quarterback."
"Vernon Davis","If and when Jordan Reed gets injured - Davis will step right in as a top 12 fantasy tight end once again. That doesn't mean he is worth drafting - but if Reed gets hurt during the pre-season and you need a tight end - rush to pick up Davis quickly."
"Brandon LaFell","Once he stepped in for an injured A.J. Green in 2016 to produce 862 yards and six touchdowns - most though LaFell had developed a clear role on the team. The odd part was that even though John Ross didn't play - LaFell took a big step back and finished with just 548 yards and three touchdowns. My belief is that Ross plays a lot more this year - forcing LaFell to lose some much-needed snaps for production. He's someone you snag if Green were to get hurt again - but that's about it."
"Dante Pettis","While I wasn't a huge Pettis fan coming into the NFL Draft - I must re-evaluate how I value you him considering the 49ers felt it necessary to trade up in the second-round to acquire him. He may not have a very significant passing role in 2018 - but it shouldn't surprise you if they try to work him in a lot more as the season goes on."
"Charles Sims","Most didn't even realize that Sims was a free agent this offseason - but he was - only to be unsigned all the way up to a week before the NFL Draft when the Bucs gave him a one-year deal. He's been really hit-or-miss throughout his NFL career - averaging 2.8 yards per carry in 2014 - then 2.9 yards per carry in 2016 - but he did average 4.9 yards per carry in-between those two seasons in 2015. He's a passing-down specialist - something the Bucs don't need much help with nowadays with all their receiving threats. Sims is just a boring fantasy option and one who shouldn't be drafted."
"Corey Grant","After watching Chris Ivory exit to the Bills - Grant has inched his way closer to fantasy relevance. With Leonard Fournette continually dealing with injuries - Grant should always be prepared to step-in alongside T.J. Yeldon should Fournette miss any time. In his short stints - Grant has impressed - totaling 412 yards and three touchdowns on 62 carries (6.65 YPC) the last two seasons."
"Gerald Everett","While everyone else debates which Rams wide receiver you want to own - it's very possible that Sean McVay overhauls his process and includes Everett much more in his second season. He was a second-round pick last year - so it's clear they loved his skill-set - though he topped four targets just once in 2017 and that was in Week 17 when they were resting starters. You don't want to bet on him being more involved - but being attached to a high-scoring offense isn't a bad thing for a former second-round pick. He's one of the higher upside tight ends going outside the top-20 at his position."
"James Washington","Washington was not the most athletic receiver in the draft class - but he may be the most complete football player among the crop of receivers. The Steelers are expected to start him right away in three-receiver sets - and while he will have to compete with some stellar players for targets - that still leaves him well worth owning this year."
"Chase Edmonds","Even though he was selected in just the fourth-round and he's now on a team with David Johnson - Edmonds may control his own fate during this offseason. Not only did David Johnson miss the 2017 season - but he's still yet to return to the practice field in what is a brand new offense. Johnson is also on the final year of his contract - meaning that if Edmonds continues to impress while Johnson is out - they may not want to pony-up a whole lot of dough this offseason to re-sign Johnson. Edmonds is just a handcuff at this moment - but he could be one of those guys who surprises if given the opportunity."
"Sam Bradford","Bradford is no lock to hold his job through the pre-season and we know he is as injury prone as they come - but if he does end up starting - Bradford offers much more than the general public will remember. He is by no means a QB1 or even close - but you can bet on him for a few strong streaming starts."
"Courtland Sutton","It's highly unlikely that we see a whole lot of Sutton in year one - as both Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders were retained for the 2018 season. Sutton doesn't play the slot position quite yet - which will hinder his playing time."
"Trent Taylor","It's difficult to figure out where Taylor fits in with the 49ers plans this year - as his 60 targets in 2017 were somewhat misleading. Not only was Pierre Garcon hurt for over half the season - but Marquise Goodwin took some time to get going. This offseason didn't help things - either - as the 49ers actually traded-up in the second-round to acquire Dante Pettis. While I believe Taylor gets the first shot - he's obviously on a short leash - which makes him a risky proposition."
"Zay Jones","After finishing as the least efficient receiver in all of football last year - Jones will actually receive a downgrade at quarterback in 2018. On top of that - he may not be ready mentally to play football - as he had an ugly offseason mental episode that would up getting him hospitalized. If he is cleared - his path to targets is extremely easy - so it's impossible to completely dismiss him. It's still difficult to love him in fantasy on a team that might not throw 18 touchdowns all season."
"Lamar Jackson","As it stands in June - it seems Jackson just may steal the job from Flacco. Whether that happens in the preseason or mid-season - he becomes a top 15 fantasy quarterback right away because of the floor his rushing ability offers."
"Ed Dickson","There's a divide of analysts on Dickson - as some believe he's the clear-cut starting tight end in Seattle - but I'm not willing to give him that title based on his body of work. He'll be 31 years old this season - on his third team - and has never eclipsed 528 yards in a season. Sure - he had a 175-yard game last year with Greg Olsen out - but he didn't top 36 yards in any game after that one. He's a fine No. 2 tight end - but I'd like to think the Seahawks want their own third-round draft pick Nick Vannett to win that job as he enters year-three. Should Dickson be named the starter - he'll move up my draft board."
"Tyler Kroft","It isn't exactly fair to expect anyone to get hurt - but at this point in Eifert's career - it is the most likely scenario. If it does happen - Kroft was solid last season as a streamer scoring seven touchdowns so he could be a serviceable options here and there."
"Jake Butt","Quickly forgotten due to a torn ACL right before the NFL Draft - most don't realize that Butt would've likely been picked in the top two rounds had he not suffered that injury. Now with a better quarterback situation - Butt could work his way up the depth chart relatively fast - as Jeff Heuerman isn't someone you should worry about. Keep an eye on the Broncos tight end competition - because there's some production that can be found."
"Jonathan Stewart","You have to wonder if Stewart knew when he signed that the Giants were planning to draft a running back. Because as of now - Stewart might not ever play significant snaps ever again with Saquon Barkley in the fold. It seems that if something happened to Barkley - both Stewart and Wayne Gallman would split the load - though Gallman would likely have more value due to his contributions in the passing-game."
"Kyle Juszczyk","It's sometimes easy to look over the fullback - buy Juszczyk has now totaled at least 33 receptions and 266 yards in each of the last three seasons. He's only totaled 14 carries over that span - but if you're in a league where you must start 3-4 running backs - he could be some cheap production."
"DeAndre Washington","It seemed like Washington was all set to take over the starting role from Latavius Murray a year ago - then the Raiders signed Marshawn Lynch. It then seemed like he'd take it once Lynch retired - but then the Raiders signed Doug Martin. It's clear that he's not in their future plans - despite being efficient on a per-touch basis. He's just a guy on their depth chart who'll pop at times - but there's simply too much salary/experience in front of him on the depth chart."
"Rod Smith","Smith is someone who is likely too low on everyone's board. While you can't project him as a top-50 running back - his value might be greater than that as Ezekiel Elliott's backup. We saw him succeed behind a lesser offensive last year - totaling 232 yards and four touchdowns on just 55 carries - including another 202 yards and touchdown on 19 receptions. If anything were to happen to Elliott - Smith would become the waiver wire add of the year."
"Brice Butler","I wonder if Butler is upset about his landing spot now that the Cardinals drafted Christian Kirk and they're saying that he'll be on the field no matter what. That means Butler now has to compete with J.J. Nelson for the No. 3 wide receiver role in the offense. It's going to be a run-heavy offense - so it's very unlikely he even has an impact if he does beat out Nelson. You're better off looking elsewhere in drafts."
"Stephen Anderson","It'd be nice if we knew who held the Texans starting tight end spot heading into draft season - as they have the easiest tight end schedule in the league. Anderson had a few solid performances last year - including a five-catch - 79-yard - one-touchdown performance against the Titans in Week 13. Still - it could be Ryan Griffin or rookie Jordan Akins who takes the job. It's one to watch during the preseason."
"John Ross","Just because Marvin Lewis didn't use John Ross last year doesn't mean that he is a crummy football player or that the Bengals won't get him targets this season. Granted - he is far from safe - but there is plenty of upside here to be found at the end of your drafts."
"Jeremy Hill","After lighting the fantasy world on fire his rookie season - Hill has never been able to recapture that magic that won fantasy titles. He's averaged just 3.63 yards per carry since that time - but has been good around the goal-line (outside of 2017) - scoring 29 touchdowns in his first three seasons. The Patriots obviously know his limitations in the passing-game and will likely have him and Mike Gillislee compete for the same roster spot. There's little reason to think Hill will pop back up on the fantasy radar."
"Travis Benjamin","There's not much love for Benjamin and that's because he's fourth on the Chargers depth chart. He scored just 4.5 fewer fantasy points than Tyrell Williams on four fewer targets - but one of them moves down the depth chart while Mike Williams moves up - and it's got to be Benjamin. He's one injury away from being fantasy relevant."
"Taylor Gabriel","The landing spot seemed much better for Gabriel before the Bears landed Anthony Miller in the draft - someone who will come in and demand targets from the get-go. Still - Gabriel is a speedy wide receiver that Matt Nagy will likely use in a variety of ways. Some have said he's the closest comp to Tyreek Hill on the Bears - but I'd disagree on that. He's a field-stretcher who will see a lot of one-on-one coverage with Allen Robinson playing on the opposite side of the field. He's not going to be a weekly contributor - but think about someone like Travis Benjamin in 2017."
"Adam Shaheen","So much for that second-year breakout that most were expecting when Matt Nagy was hired - eh? One of the first signings in free agency was Trey Burton - smashing the hopes of Shaheen supporters - as he's now become the backup. They have said that they will run plenty of 2TE sets - so it's possible that Shaheen gets on the field even with Burton - but there's not enough room for production. He's someone you snag off waivers should something happen to Burton."
"Tavon Austin","Tavon has a ridiculous contract - yet the Cowboys insisted on acquiring him anyway. Now - they are suggesting he may see a dozen touches per game out of the backfield. That is clearly stupid and not going to happen - but it is well worth noting that the Cowboys seem to have plans for him."
"Jalen Richard","Despite averaging almost 5.5 yards per carry over the last two seasons - the Raiders felt it necessary to bring in Doug Martin this offseason - essentially destroying any value that Richard could have had in the offense. Both him and DeAndre Washington could be fighting for the same opportunity in training camp - and it might be better if they do release him so he can find a team who can use him."
"James Conner","We aren't sure if the exit of Todd Haley will mean more snaps for Le'Veon Bell's backup running back - but my guess would be no. In fact - we don't even know if the Steelers view Conner as the clear-cut backup to Bell - though he'd definitely be in the mix for touches. He's just a unsure handcuff at this point."
"Garrett Celek","You may be surprised to discover this - but in the five games Jimmy G started for the 49ers - Celek was a top-five fantasy TE while Kittle was top 10. Even though Kittle will likely end up higher this season - that doesn't change the fact that Garoppolo may be able to support two top 15 tight ends."
"Chad Williams","The forgotten man in the Cardinals wide receiver corps - but you really shouldn't forget about a guy they spent a third-round pick on just a year ago. If Sam Bradford can stay healthy - it's possible that Williams finds his way into a few fantasy relevant weeks - though he's far off the radar in standard leagues."
"Mark Walton","Walton is third on the Bengals depth chart - there's no doubt about that. What's important is that he'd only need one injury to contribute to fantasy leagues - as both Joe Mixon and Giovani Bernard are slated to receive 8-plus touches per week. Walton was likely brought on to be Bernard's replacement - as he's a free agent after this season. Walton is known to be excellent in pass-protection and someone who can play on all three downs if necessary."
"Keke Coutee","It didn't take long for Coutee to start turning heads in training camp - just like I thought he would. He's a weapon who reminds me of Tyreek Hill - though he's not going to have the type of impact that Hill has with DeAndre Hopkins and Will Fuller on the field. Still - Coutee is going to have some big weeks if you're looking for someone as an upside bye week filler."
"Joe Williams","Here we are - just one year after beat reporters claimed that Williams was going to take the starting job from Carlos Hyde. Not only did he not do that - but even now with Hyde gone - it seems Williams is firmly planted as the No. 3 running back on the depth chart behind both Jerick McKinnon and Matt Breida. While I wasn't on board with him last year - he might turn out to be a sleeper in drafts this year. McKinnon has struggled with early-down work throughout his career - and the 49ers showed no confidence in Breida as a workhorse when they signed McKinnon. He's nobody you should draft right now - but keep a close eye on him in the preseason."
"Justin Jackson","Many are suggesting Eckeler is the backup to Melvin Gordon - but more likely - he will primarily help in the passing game. It is Justin Jackson who would likely fill in should Gordon go down - and with the offensive line - Jackson could be a star if that scenario were to play out and he saw major touches."
"Josh McCown","It appeared that McCown was going to be handed the starting job for at least the first few weeks - but there's noise coming out of Jets camp that Teddy Bridgewater looks really good. With that being the case - it's hard to invest any pick in McCown - because we know that Sam Darnold will be given the keys to the offense before long."
"Taywan Taylor","If you're looking to hedge against the Corey Davis breakout that everyone is expecting - Taylor is someone that should entice you. He was one of my favorites coming out of the draft last year as someone who reminded me of Kendall Wright - but could play on the perimeter. He didn't get many opportunities with Eric Decker there last year - but Taylor did well with the 28 targets he did see - totaling 231 yards and a touchdown. He's going to be on the field in all 3WR sets"
"Dallas Goedert","He'll be taking place of Trey Burton - who had a few very usable weeks last year when Zach Ertz was ailing. He's going to have a few games that trick you into liking him more than you should - but you should know that the only time you should trust him in your lineup is if Ertz misses a game. If that should happen - Goedert shoots up into the TE1 conversation."
"Travaris Cadet","Cadet didn't come to the Bills until later in the season - but when he did - he had a role in the offense. Over the final six games of the season - he carried the ball 22 times for 93 yards and caught 13 passes for 93 yards. With the lack of receiving options on the roster - it's likely that he's involved once again - though it'd take an injury to LeSean McCoy for him to see a large uptick in production."
"Jacquizz Rodgers","It seems like Rodgers might not even make the Bucs 53-man roster - as they will be carrying Ronald Jones - Charles Sims - and Peyton Barber clearly ahead of him on the depth chart."
"De'Angelo Henderson","He was someone who made an impact last preseason - but it didn't amount to many touches in the regular season with C.J. Anderson - Jamaal Charles - and Devontae Booker in the mix. While Anderson and Charles are gone - the Broncos did draft Royce Freeman in the third-round. Still - it's possible that Henderson is a better running back than Booker and usurps him at some point. He's not draft-worthy - but he's someone to monitor in deep leagues."
"Amara Darboh","After losing both Jimmy Graham and Paul Richardson this offseason - the Seahawks are going to be looking for someone to find the end zone with a tad more frequency. Darboh is 6-foot-2 and 215 pounds - and could be the player to step into a starting role. He was drafted in the third-round last year - so the Seahawks obviously felt like he would be a contributor before long. He's one of those guys you can take with your last draft pick and you should know what you've got after the first week or two."
"Virgil Green","As of the time I'm writing this - Green is slated to be the Chargers starting tight end - though I don't know if it lasts all that long. Despite lackluster competition on the Broncos - Green couldn't hold the job and was supposed to be the Chargers No. 2 tight end behind Hunter Henry. If for whatever reason the Chargers do move forward with Green as their guy - he'll move up the rankings - but his ceiling is nowhere near that of Henry or even Antonio Gates - who had serious rapport with Philip Rivers. He's 30 years old and has never topped 237 yards or one touchdown in a single season."
"Malcolm Mitchell","With Julian Edelman's pending four-game suspension and the exit of Brandin Cooks - the wide receiver depth chart is sort of wide-open after Chris Hogan. Most have forgotten about Mitchell's last six games with Tom Brady that produced 25 receptions for 309 yards and four touchdowns. If Mitchell can bounce back from his injury that knocked him out of 2017 - he could have a few fantasy relevant weeks."
"Sam Darnold","With both Josh McCown and Teddy Bridgewater as veterans on the team - it's nearly impossible that Darnold starts before the second-half of the season. He's not someone you should be drafting - outside of deep 2QB leagues - but even then - you'll likely need the bench spots for someone who'll contribute sooner."
"Baker Mayfield","While I don't expect Mayfield to start Week 1 - this has John Fox in Chicago written all over it. After saying that Mitch Trubisky wasn't going to start - they had no choice but to go to the rookie. While Tyrod Taylor isn't Mike Glennon-bad - he's not going to carry the team to new heights - which is what is needed to save Hue Jackson's job. If you're looking for a rookie to snag at the end of a keeper draft - Mayfield is the one to do it with - as he's got Russell Wilson-type upside - just don't expect him to start for at least half the season."
"Teddy Bridgewater","It seemed like one of the oddest signings of the offseason - as the Jets already had Josh McCown on the roster and we knew they were going quarterback with the No. 3 pick in the draft. Still - Bridgewater has reportedly turned heads at Jets OTAs - making him legit competition for McCown as the Week 1 starter while Sam Darnold waits in the wings. If Bridgewater does win the job - he will be a low-end QB2 while he has the job with some upside if he regains the mobility he once had."
"Mark Andrews","Andrews is someone who reminded me of Jason Witten with the way he maneuvered his way through routes in college. He wasn't fast - but seemed to get open quite a bit - becoming a favorite of Baker Mayfield in the process. He can't block very well - which may limit his playing time - as will their first-round pick Hayden Hurst. The Ravens use their tight end a lot - but knowing that Andrews was taken two rounds later than Hurst - he's clearly in a backup role."
"Nick Vannett","There are a lot of fantasy analysts overlooking Vannett - who was drafted in the third-round a couple years ago waiting in the wings behind both Jimmy Graham and Luke Willson - who are both with new teams in 2018. Yes - the Seahawks did bring in Ed Dickson - but he's not someone who should eliminate Vannett from the starting conversation. He's a big - athletic tight end who could develop into one of Russell Wilson's go-to targets in the red zone."
"Clive Walford","Seemingly left for dead by the Raiders - the tight end-needy Jets decided to pick up the once highly sought-after Walford - who is still just 26 years old. They have last year's rookie Jordan Leggett coming back from injury - but he's essentially still a rookie. I don't expect much production out of the Jets tight end position - but if there's one who I'd project to lead them in receiving - it's probably Walford. This is one positional battle we'll watch in the preseason to ensure we have it right."
"Josh Rosen","It's possible that Rosen landed in the best spot for his chance to be the starter right away - as Sam Bradford has a bad history of knee injuries and still hasn't been fully cleared. With them both learning a new offense - it's well within the realm of possibilities that Rosen starts Week 1. He's still a rookie - so expectations must be kept in check - but he'd be worth a draft pick in 2QB leagues."
"Robert Turbin","Putting Turbin inside the top-200 is not something anyone wants to do - but with reports that he may be the LeGarrette Blount to Frank Reich's offense - he should be moving up draft boards. While that role is extremely touchdown-dependent - it still has a place in fantasy football - especially when they're projected to be in the lead or in a projected shootout. I'd likely rather roster a high-upside backup - but if you're desperate for someone to get 5-10 touches per week - he can fill that role."
"Alfred Blue","After sitting out there as a free agent - Blue wound up signing with the Texans again. It may turn out to be nothing - but Blue did receive 46 carries over the teams final three games - including 22 touches in Week 17. If D'Onta Foreman starts the season on the PUP list - it's possible that Blue is in a timeshare with Lamar Miller."
"Mike Gillislee","We've come a long way since Gillislee's three-touchdown game in Week 1 last year - eh? Since that time - we've seen both Rex Burkhead and Dion Lewis in extended roles - Jeremy Hill signed to a one-year deal - and then Sony Michel drafted with a first-round pick. It helps that Lewis left via free agency - but as of now - Gillislee is no lock to make the roster and it likely comes down to him or Hill. I'd bet on Gillislee winning that battle - but his fantasy relevance isn't something that you should gamble on. If you play in a league where you draft over 200 players - sure - he can have some value as a high-upside backup - but it seems he found his way into Bill Belichick's doghouse and won't get out any time soon."
"Carlos Henderson","There are a lot of people who have forgotten about Henderson after he missed his rookie season with a hand injury - but he was the guy most compared to Golden Tate last offseason. He's a monster after the catch and can play anywhere on the field - though the slot is his likely destination in 2018. He got into some trouble this offseason - but if he can stay on the field - he'll have to beat out rookie DaeSean Hamilton - who is solid in his own right. Henderson is someone you should watch closely in the preseason."
"Terrance West","The Saints are insistent that Kamara won't be a workhorse with Ingram out - and they just signed West - so you can expect him to assume the Mark Ingram role for the first four weeks. Granted - he isn't as good - but if you need a flex - remember just how good even Tim Hightower was in this role when Ingram was injured."
"AJ McCarron","It seems like McCarron is the favorite to start Week 1 for the Bills - but a non-mobile quarterback behind an offensive line that lost three starters this offseason? Not just that - but his pass-catchers are one of the worst groups in the league."
"Rico Gathers","He's someone you need to keep an eye on throughout the preseason - as the Cowboys starting tight end position is wide open. He'll compete with a few rookies - making me believe he'll get the job after dominating last preseason. He gained almost 20 pounds this offseason to help with his blocking - but hopefully it doesn't take away from what he does best - catch the ball. With the lack of playmakers on the Cowboys - they need someone to step up and Gathers has it in him as a receiver."
"Tre'Quan Smith","He could have a Brandon Coleman-type season where he pops up on the fantasy radar for a week or two - but there's going to be nothing steady about his production unless something happens to Ted Ginn or Cameron Meredith."
"Benny Cunningham","It seems that everyone has forgotten about Cunningham on the Bears roster - as the conversation comes down to Tarik Cohen and Jordan Howard all the time. Well - Cunningham was solid in his passing-down role last year - catching 20 passes for 240 yards and two touchdowns. He could be the veteran presence that Matt Nagy likes and wants to keep around - which would give him just a small amount of value in DEEP leagues."
"Cameron Artis-Payne","Some were slating Artis-Payne for a bigger workload this year - but the signing of C.J. Anderson quickly ended that debate. He'll go back to being the No. 3 on the depth chart and will only have relevance with multiple injuries."
"Josh Allen","As of now - it appears unlikely that Allen will start the season for the Bills - as A.J. McCarron is the front-runner for the job. It's only a matter of time before they go to Allen - though - so he's got some bench value in 2QB leagues as someone who will use his legs. His ceiling is capped due to the pass-catchers - but once he does start - he should be a semi-high-floor QB2."
"Laquon Treadwell","If something doesn't happen with Treadwell in 2018 - it's likely not going to end well. He's now seen just 38 career targets over his first two seasons - hauling in 21 of them for 215 yards. The Vikings went out and signed Kendall Wright in free agency - though that seems to be a depth chart move with Adam Thielen occupying the slot. Treadwell should be on the field in 3WR sets - but if the past two years are any indication to his involvement - he's not going to be fantasy relevant."
"Mike Davis","You have to wonder if Davis is regretting his decision to re-up his contract with the Seahawks after they drafted Rashaad Penny with their first-round pick. Not only him is in Davis' way - either - as Chris Carson has reportedly looked good in mini-camp. Davis is third on the depth chart and that's not even including C.J. Prosise - who may be playing wide receiver."
"Damien Williams","An under-the-radar signing this offseason - as Williams has shown to be a capable third-down running back - but it's odd that he chose to sign in a crowded Chiefs backfield that now includes Kareem Hunt - Spencer Ward - Charcandrick West - and him. They wouldn't have signed him without a plan - so it's possible that he takes over West's old role. Still - that's just a 3-5 touch per week role that doesn't have much value."
"Jacoby Brissett","With each passing day - it seems the Andrew Luck situation is getting murkier. Now having failed to throw a football in 17 months - it's fair to think that he may not ever return to form. If he doesn't - they may decide to shut him down sooner than most - meaning Brissett would re-enter the fantasy conversation."
